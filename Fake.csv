ppened to be right.Albright slammed Trump for kissing up to dictators, especially the likes of Kim Jong Un. I think that part of the issue is that President Trump seems to believe that he can have just one-on-one relationships. And maybe that s possible in business, but that is not something that is possible as president of the United States,  she said.  This is not a matter of charming, by saying you re  honored  and he s a  smart cookie.' The former secretary of state has spoken out against Trump and his piss poor excuse for foreign policy from the very beginning of his candidacy.

His gymnastics around Donald Trump s antics and gaffes (along with his own) are already the stuff of legend, and not in a good way.

Sean? Hey, Sean, come on! What about the Putin call, Sean?  The caption under their photo reads,  It just like concluded. The Root had its own take: Perhaps Spicer needed some time to compose the  alternative facts  he knew he d have to present after Salmon-Skin Stalin said Tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Appropriations Committee s ranking Democratic member, responded on Twitter with,  To be clear, there is NO funding in this bill for ANY kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall. Or, maybe Spicer was nervous about responding to Trump s tweets from earlier Tuesday insisting that the government needed a  good shutdown.' While some blindly loyal Trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press, unfortunately for their narrative and for Spicey here, answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job. He doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk, or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else. Really, Spicer just got owned here.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 2, 2017"

 Trump Mocked For Inventing Fake Civil War Battle On His Golf Course – There’s A Plaque And Everything (TWEETS),"Frederick Douglass and Andrew Jackson will be very disappointed in Donald Trump when they learn he fibbed a teensy bit about a Civil War battle he says happened on one of his golf courses. According to a plaque   yes, a plaque   Trump proudly displays at the  Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, the length of the Potomac River that borders his course is called the River of Blood because both Union and Southern soldiers died en masse between the 14th and 15th holes. The  FAILING  New York Times reported in 2015:Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating  The River of Blood. Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,  the inscription reads.  The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as  The River of Blood. The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump s full name, concludes:  It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River! The site does have historical significance alongside the Bowling Green Massacre, in that its historical significance is completely made up. No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,  said Richard Gillespie, executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, said of Trump s claim. Gillespie added that the only thing  close to  that was the  Battle of Ball s Bluff in 1861 in which several hundred Union solders were killed. It happened 11 miles upriver, nowhere near the  River of Blood. Called on his lie, Trump attempted to salvage his story by explaining: That was a prime site for river crossings. So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot   a lot of them. Historians say that literally no one has ever died in that crossing, but Trump complains that someone might have died at some point. How would they know that?  Trump said angrily after learning that historians say his stupid plaque is FAKE NEWS.  Were they there?  Trump says  numerous historians  have confirmed the  River of Blood.  He did not know any of their names. Embarrassingly for Trump, even Golf Digest took the time to debunk the blood river.Sadly, this is not the first mass killing invented by the Trump Administration. With the Bowling Green Massacre, the Atlanta massacre, and that thing that happened in Sweden and now the  River of Blood,  it seems that we may not be able to trust this administration, shockingly. Naturally, the Internet finds this news hilarious:.@GolfDigest Making up a battle named ""The River of Blood"" is creeeeeeeepy. #creepyoldpresidentmakingupbattles very creeeeeeeeeeeepy  Mr.Quagmire (@Mr_Quagmire_USA) May 2, 2017#TrumpTeachesHistory by commemorating a fictional battle, ""The River of Blood,"" yeah well, didn't happen  #TuesdayThoughts https://t.co/GjdtaKi6Os  Atoz ?

 CNN Refuses To Air Trump’s First 100 Days Ad For One Very Good Reason – See For Yourself (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s self-congratulatory ad to celebrate his first 100 days in the White House is gross enough to make you want to shudder and vomit. It s full of Trump s  accomplishments  (there aren t many) and portray Trump in a light that is clearly not in line with his true character and behavior.If you ve been fortunate enough not to see this ad yet, you can watch it below if you want to ruin your whole day:One network has already rejected the ad and refused to air it. After CNN reviewed the ad, they decided not to accept it because of the way Trump s team portrayed the media as  fake news. And as usual, Trump s team responded in the most childish way. In a statement on Trump s campaign website, titled: Fake News Station Refuses to Run Ad Highlighting the President s First 100 Days , his team wrote this: It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country. It s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn t fit their narrative,  said Michael Glassner, Executive Director.CNN takes issue with the ad s message calling out the mainstream media for peddling fake news and not reporting on the fact that President Trump is making America great again.CNN has struck back, explaining their decision to keep the ad off of the network until the  fake news  graphic was taken off. Trump s attack on the media is absolutely disgusting, and it s only helped them. It s been proven that Americans trust the mainstream media far more than the President   and this is exactly why. We hope that more networks will follow in CNN s footsteps, because no one should have to look at Trump s lies.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2017"
 Andrew Jackson Biographer: Trump Actually Said He Could Have Prevented The Civil War (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Andrew Jackson-Civil War debacle just continues to get worse and worse.Yesterday, Trump had a massive history fail during a radio interview, where the moronic POTUS stated that Andrew Jackson   who had died 16 years before the Civil War even started   was angry that the war had not been avoided. Trump also said that Jackson could have stopped the Civil War from happening, lavishing praise upon the slave-owning seventh president. And apparently, Trump also thinks that HE could have stopped the Civil War.Trump s disgusting Civil War comments have prompted Andrew Jackson biographer and historian Jon Meacham, the author of  American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House, to speak out and address Trump s comments. According to Meacham, it was White House chief strategist Steve Bannon that made Trump fall in love with Jackson. The historian explained on MSNBC today: I spent an hour, hour and a half with him in May of  16 talking with him about presidents he admired and Jackson never came up. Steve Bannon put this in the conversation after the victory saying this was a Jacksonian moment. It was then that Trump connected himself to Jackson in his usual superficial way. Meacham said: It s a projection of the president s fundamental and enveloping narcissism. And then Meacham dropped this bombshell: He told me a year and a half ago or so, a year ago, that, you know, he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the war. Yes, Trump actually said he could have prevented the war with one of his deals. If it s anything like the  deals  and failed legislation we ve seen so far during his presidency, it s safe to say that Trump would have f*cked that up, too.Meacham also said that being in the White House tends to enhance the  fundamental characteristics  of the serving presidents   which is awful news for America right now. Meacham said: It s very hard, once you re there, to change. Some people do, and that s why we talk about them as great presidents. But most people, once they re in the Oval Office, actually just become more like themselves   and I think in this case that s on a particularly tragic trajectory. We couldn t agree more.

 WATCH: Colbert HUMILIATES Trump With Scathing Takedown To Avenge Attack On John Dickerson,"When you insult CBS, Stephen Colbert goes on the offensive. And Donald Trump is going to have a mental meltdown when he sees this.On Sunday, CBS host John Dickerson interviewed Donald Trump on Face The Nation.After being asked about his pathetic first 100 days, Trump whined about the  fake  media and then insulted Dickerson by saying that he refers to his show as  Deface The Nation. It s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge,  Trump said.  It s very funny when the fake media goes out   which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say is you. You mean, me personally?  Dickerson asked. Your show, I love your show,  Trump replied.  I call it  Deface the Nation , but your show is sometimes not exactly correct. Trump s insult went viral and was heavily criticized for being the kind of behavior that is beneath the presidency.But Trump created a bigger problem for himself than he thought because Dickerson s friend Stephen Colbert also works for CBS, and while Dickerson had to exercise professionalism and restraint, Colbert informed Trump that as a comedian he isn t held to same standard. Donald Trump, John Dickerson is a fair-minded journalist and one of the most competent people who will ever walk into your office,  Colbert said.  John Dickerson has way too much dignity to trade insults with the president of the United States to his face. But I, sir, am no John Dickerson. With the gauntlet thrown down, Colbert proceeded to tear Trump apart with a scathing round of insults that will turn Trump into a stuttering mess if he ever sees it. Mr. Trump, your presidency? I love your presidency, I call it  Disgrace the Nation.  Colbert said.  You re not the POTUS, you re the BLOTUS. You re the glutton with a button. You re a regular  Gorge  Washington. You re the presi-dunce. But you re turning into a real prictator. You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head. You have more people marching against you than cancer. And then Colbert delivered the knockout blow. Sir, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s d*ck holster. Absolutely. Sick.

 ‘Grow The F*ck Up!’: Trump Gets Taken To The Woodshed After Calling For A Government Shutdown,"Just yesterday, amateur president Donald Trump made an ass out of himself by failing at history, and today, he s calling for a future government shutdown. Only Trump could f*ck up the past and the future, all in 24-hours. Trump wants to shut down the very government he s leading, which is a thing a real president would try to avoid. Former President Barack Obama made concessions in order to avoid a government shutdown, but the man-baby POTUS is whining on Twitter over the deal which was reached on a $1 trillion-plus bill to fund the government for the final five months of this fiscal year.Even though Republicans control Congress, the Senate and they have installed a Republican  president,  Trump did not get funding for his ineffective border wall, taxpayer dollars will not be spent on a deportation force, the bill includes $295 million for Puerto Rico s Medicaid program and Congress  budget will not defund Planned Parenthood. And that s just the short list.Obviously, this has upset the former reality show star, who previously deemed himself to be a great negotiator.On Twitter, he wrote,  The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We . The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We .  Donald J.

Our country needs a good ""shutdown"" in September to fix mess!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017So, if he doesn t get his way he wants to change the rules. There s a reason the prospect of a government shutdown is hugely unpopular, so one Twitter user schooled him.@realDonaldTrump You're reckless. Shutting down the government isn't like closing a casino. The last government shutdown cost the economy ~$24B/0.6% GDP.

Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NatlParkService @USTravel  @realDonaldTrump, if the government does in fact shutdown, it means you didn't do your job.

These consumption taxes disproportionately affect low/middle income ppl.  Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) May 2, 2017It s true that Trump is literally calling for an increase in gas tax. We remember when conservatives blamed Obama for gas price increases when that was not in his control, but now a Republican  president  wants to deliberately raise the price of gas through a tax increase.Twitter users were not amused by Trump s reckless tweet.@realDonaldTrump Wait.

 Trump Just Claimed Andrew Jackson Had Psychic Powers And The Internet Was Not Kind To Him (TWEETS),"In an interview with Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito, Donald Trump managed to utter one of the dumbest series of sentences in human history:I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said,  There s no reason for this.  People don t realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why?People don t ask that question. But why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?Now, if Trump was an intelligent human being, he might admit he is completely uneducated regarding Andrew Jackson, the Civil War, and pretty much everything else. He would apologize. He would say he was wrong. But Trump? Well, he s a f*cking moron.In what appears to be an effort to convince people he was somehow right when he claimed that Andrew Jackson used the psychic powers bestowed upon him by Satan himself in exchange for that whole Trail of Tears thing Steve Bannon keeps saying we should do again (at least, we can reasonably assume Bannon says that) to foresee  a conflict that occurred 16 years after his death   and he was f*cking pissed about it.President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017Andrew Jackson would have, had he actually possessed the magical ability to foresee the future, almost certainly used his powers for evil. Slaves represented the majority of Jackson s income. He owned 150 of them when he died. If Jackson had actually known what was coming, he would have done all he could to ensure a Southern victory   you know, had he not died 16 years before the Civil War began. Trump is correct that our seventh President would have been very  angry  about what he would certainly call the War of Northern Aggression, however had he had a heartbeat.Trump s attempt to smooth things over by claiming that Jackson was a psychic didn t quite go over in the world of Twitterville, with Americans stopping by to collectively ask  What the f*ck is wrong with you? @realDonaldTrump You wish that Andrew Jackson an owner of HUNDREDS of slaves should've just made a deal w the South to allow slavery?! pic.twitter.com/We1qOHLlm8  William LeGate (@williamlegate) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Was he angry because he had 150+ slaves?

 Dan Rather Breaks The Internet With SEARING Rebuke Of Trump’s ‘Andrew Jackson’ Comment,"With Trump in the White House, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has an awful lot to say, probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times, and Trump is a dangerous buffoon, the likes of which we ve never seen. He doesn t comment on everything, and he apparently didn t want to comment on Trump s idea that Andrew Jackson was angry about the Civil War. But he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out.According to his Facebook post on the topic, the  sheer craziness of this obsession by Donald Trump with Andrew Jackson and the Civil War is a carnival act unlike anything I have ever seen at the White House. These are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing. Should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half-baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history? Trump, at the very least, has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history. He recently told Reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard. He also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.Sure, Trump. The only people who did know are, well, pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation.That isn t all Rather blasted Trump about. He also dropped this truth bomb, with hell of a burn at the end, on Trump: To be President of the United States is to part of the great American story. To not understand that story is to not understand the presidency. Maybe Frederick Douglass can give Mr. Trump some advice. Apparently, he s  an example of somebody who s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more.

 Sean Spicer: Trump Did Not Say That Thing Everyone Heard Him Say (VIDEO),"White House press secretary Sean Spicer literally denied the meaning of alleged president Donald Trump s words during a briefing on Monday. The former reality show star gave a bizarre interview earlier on Monday on CBS  Face the Nation from the Oval Office in which Trump once again, said that former president Barack Obama illegally tapped his phone lines.  I don t stand by anything,  Trump told John Dickerson.  I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. The interview ended abruptly with Trump walking away after being pressed by the reporter to back up his claim. So, Spicer was asked about that crazy-time interview then twisted himself into a pretzel in an attempt to defend his boss. The president said,  I don t stand by anything.  How is the American public supposed to digest that, supposed to trust what the president says when he himself says, of his own comments, I don t by anything,  a pool reporter asked Spicer. I think the point is, he clearly stands by that,  Spicer said.  That s something that s made very clear if you look at the entire back and forth exchange. Even though the exchange is documented on video after being televised, Spicer insisted that what we heard is not what we all heard. It was about wiretapping,  the reporter pressed on when asked to be specific. Spicer said it  was a long back and forth  and added that he  clearly stands by that. So, Trump stands by his  I don t stand by anything  remark as well as his conspiracy-theory based wiretap claim. Watch: You don t have to ask me,  Trump responded to one of Dickerson s attempts to clarify his baseless claim.  Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. The House and Senate Intelligence committees previously announced that there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. As for Spicer repeatedly asking for clarification, let s help him out. Trump made baseless and unprecedented attacks on his predecessor and his White House press secretary is defending him. Also, according to Trump and his White House press secretary, the alleged president doesn t  stand by anything.  Still yet, Spicer feigned to know nothing about the interview, repeatedly asking for clarification.Why is it when Trump says something, we need it to be translated? Then Spicer muddles it even more. Remember when we had a President who understood the meaning of words?Image via screen capture. ",News,"May 1, 2017"
 Ivanka Trump Legally BARRED From Participating In Any Trump Businesses,"The Office of Government Ethics has said that Ivanka Trump must file financial disclosure forms, and that she s barred from participating in anything related to the Trump family s businesses because she s an adviser to her father in the White House. The ethics office was never contacted about her role, revealing yet another area in which the White House is either sorely ignorant or sorely corrupt (most likely both).Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper asked the ethics office about the rules that Ivanka is supposed to follow. At the time they asked, Ivanka was in the process of getting her government-issued devices and a security clearance, and her lawyer had already said she would stick to the same ethics rules applied to every other government employee.This is what the ethics office told Warren and Carper about the ethics rules applying to her: [T]he primary criminal conflict of interest statue prohibits senior White House appointees and other executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters directly and predictably affecting their financial interests. Among other things, this prohibition extends to the financial interests of companies in which they have ownership interests the primary criminal conflict of interest statute prohibits Ms. Trump from participating in particular matters affecting her financial interests, including the financial interests of Trump family businesses and other companies in which she has an ownership interest. That conflict of interest statute also covers her spouse s financial interests, which are imputed to her. So even if her husband, Jared Kushner, didn t have his own White House office, he still couldn t participate in the Trump Organization either.Ivanka s company was granted trademarks in China the same day she had dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The company said that the new trademarks are normal for the business that they do, and she did place her company in a trust and resigned from her position in the Trump Organization to accept her White House role. The Trump Organization, however, has likewise received a number of trademarks in China since Trump took office.She maintains financial control of her own company, though, as well as an interest in Washington s Trump International Hotel, according to The New York Times. These ethics rules apply to financial interests, even for employees and executives who ve formally resigned from their positions in their businesses. And those Chinese trademarks, granted after she took her post in the White House, could violate the ethics rules to which she s bound. Her ability to approve or deny certain deals through her trust may violate those rules as well.Unfortunately, ethics compliance is under the purview of the White House, and the White House is pretty loyal to Donald Trump and has shown zero interest in ensuring ethical compliance. The ethics office doesn t have enforcement power   they just issue guidance. Congressional Democrats now have a powerful case against Ivanka should it come to light that she s violating these rules, though.There s word for this if she doesn t bring herself into full compliance: Corruption.Featured image by Sean Gallup via Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Tries To Launch 2020 Re-election Ad, It IMMEDIATELY Blows Up In His Face (TWEET)","From the moment Trump won the election, he was already bragging about how he was going to run again in 2020, and win.In a move that shows just how delusional Trump truly is, the undeserving POTUS ignored the fact that his approval rating has reached a historic low by launching his first ad for his 2020 bid. And in true Trump fashion, the ad was one big embarrassing fail, as Trump was forced to pull the ad over an obvious violation   it violated the ban that prevents active duty military members in uniform from participating in political stunts.The Washington Post wrote: The initial version of the ad released by the campaign included a shot of Trump shaking hands at his Mar-a-Lago estate with H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser. An updated version dropped the shot of McMaster, who remains an active duty member of the Army, and replaced it with Trump visiting a business. Campaign law expert Larry Noble also pointed this out:It should be noted that Trump pathetically celebrated Inauguration Day by filing for re-election, probably to soothe himself after seeing those tiny crowds. This ad is the perfect embodiment of Trump s sloppy administration   these people have no idea how to run the country, which trickles down to the most simple tasks.From what we ve seen from Trump himself, his White House doesn t really pay attention to detail or do their research first before going all in. Trump s team has had to repeatedly correct themselves, and not even a simple campaign ad can go off without a hitch.Not even halfway through his first term, Trump has already made his bid for re-election a joke and displayed just how incompetent his entire team is. It s no wonder the majority of Americans can t wait until this clown and the rest of his circus are out of the White House.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Has CRAZY Meltdown On ‘Face The Nation’, Ends Interview In The Most COWARDLY Way (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his team are not only some of the most corrupt people we ve ever had infiltrate our government, but they re also some of the most cowardly   and Trump has just set an example to his team that will likely give way to even more spineless behavior.In an interview with CBS s Face The Nation, Trump actually cut the interview short, ending it abruptly by literally fleeing from reporter John Dickerson when Dickerson dared to question Trump about his unfounded claims that former POTUS Barack Obama wiretapped him (Trump has STILL not been able to prove this).Dickerson was speaking to Trump inside the Oval Office when the discussion turned to Trump s relationship with Obama, and Trump made some extremely disrespectful, inflammatory remarks. Trump said he d  had some difficulties  with Obama over  what happened with surveillance.  When Dickerson cornered Trump on why he d called his predecessor  sick  and  bad  in his wiretapping accusations in March, Trump practically had a breakdown from being put on the spot while the cameras rolled. Trump gave this incoherent response: I don t stand by anything. I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. And frankly it should be discussed. I think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens. I think it s a very big topic. And it s a topic that should be number one. And we should find out what the hell is going on. Trump only seemed to get more frustrated and edgy as Dickerson tried to get to the bottom of Trump s babbling. Trump said: You don t have to ask me.Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. Dickerson had tried to hold Trump accountable, and it was just too much for the man baby. Trump suddenly ended the interview by straight up walking AWAY from Dickerson, saying  Okay, that s enough, thank you, thank you very much.

" Trump Kills Michelle Obama’s Girl Education Program, Right-Wing ‘Feminist’ Ivanka Silent","Trump has been relentlessly attempting to scrub the government of any program associated with President Obama and an extremely popular program meant to help educated girls and young women around the world has become the latest victim.Characteristically, Trump s administration gave zero defense for cutting the program, just a flat announcement that it was finished. Moving forward, we will not continue to use the  Let Girls Learn  brand or maintain a stand-alone program,  read an email sent to Peace Corps employees this week by the agency s acting director Sheila Crowley.Despite the self-created obstacles, the Peace Corps promised to continue attempting to educate young girls around the world through other means. It doesn t seem likely that they will get much input from Trump, who has not signaled that he cares about girls education one way or the other.One person not involved in this mess is Ivanka Trump   which is weird. Republicans and pundits have spent months insisting that Trump s daughter is a rebel feminist working to push her father and his administration into a more pro-woman direction. The evidence for this take on Ivanka is nonexistent. And Trump s dismantling of a program meant to educate girls seems like a perfect opportunity to put up or shut up. Her big moment to stand up for women and she is dead silent.Ivanka s imaginary check on her father didn t prevent him from going after Michelle Obama s efforts to improve school lunches, either. Obama s initiative was meant to combat America s obesity program and help kids have better access to healthy options while in school. Those reasonable goals were savaged by Republicans who by that time had spent so long hating everything the White House did that they rarely stopped to ask themselves whether the things they were after were bad.Trump inherits that knee-jerk opposition to Obama, but now as president he has the ability to actually act on it. And the one person who might have the influence to stop him proves she s all talk.Feature image via Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Frighteningly Praises North Korean Dictator For Executing People To Stay In Power,"This should concern every single American.In January 2016, Trump was in the middle of trying to secure the Republican nomination when he praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un s deadly strategy of maintaining his power. If you look at North Korea, this guy, he s like a maniac. OK? And you ve got to give him credit. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden   you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. This guy doesn t play games, and we can t play games with him. And Trump still admires that strategy more than a year later. Only this time, Trump is in the White House.During his interview with John Dickerson on Sunday, Trump once again expressed his admiration of the North Korean dictator s use of execution to remain in power. People are saying  Is he sane?  I have no idea but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He s dealing with obviously very tough people. A lot of people, I m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it, so obviously, he s a pretty smart cookie. Here s the video via CBS.This should scare Americans, especially since it appears Trump is employing other strategies that tyrants use to consolidate power.So far, Trump has used threats, intimidation, hate, and fear as tools to expand and consolidate his own power. He has attacked the media and the First Amendment. He is so paranoid that he even conducts witch hunts throughout his administration to find and fire people who leak information to the media. Anyone who criticizes him also gets fired, as one of Ben Carson s aides found out in February.And Kim Jong-Un isn t the first dictator Trump has praised. He praised Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte last year and has invited him to visit the White House. Trump has openly praised Vladimir Putin. And he shook hands with Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.A president taking the step of executing people may sound like an impossibility. But Trump exhibits most of the traits of being a fascist. He has already flouted the laws of our country and ignored the Constitution. Republicans in Congress have demonstrated that they really don t care how Trump uses his power, which means he can abuse it. And he has already done so repeatedly. Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election and he has openly accused a former sitting president of a felony. And that s on top of a mountain of lies that Trump has been telling since his inauguration. Trump has also urged his followers to beat up protesters and has made it clear that he considers Americans who oppose him as the enemy.Trump s praise of Kim Jong-Un s use of executions should make Americans scream even louder for his impeachment or resignation. There s a pattern here and Americans need to recognize it because we are only 100 days into a four-year term, and it could only be a matter of time before Trump takes his desire to be a dictator to the next level.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Freaks Out, Ends Interview When Reporter Asks Him To Prove Obama Wiretap Accusation (VIDEO)","In an unreal feat, Trump managed to have two humiliating interviews come out on the same day. While much of the country (and indeed, the world) was laughing at Trump for his insane screed about the Civil War, CBS News released their own interview with Trump which showed the president descending into sheer madness when pressed to support his (false) claim that President Obama wiretapped him. For those worried about the mental stability of the person currently within arm s reach of America s nuclear arsenal, it was perhaps the more disturbing of the two interviews.You can almost hear Trump s staffers groan when he, out of nowhere, brings up the wiretap claims. Sensing a moment to finally press Trump on these unsubstantiated smears of his predecessor, CBS s John Dickerson asks Trump pointblank whether he still stands by the accusations that Obama is a  bad and sick  guy who had committed felonies on par with Nixon s Watergate scandal. Since making the claims, Trump s arguments have been repeatedly debunked and zero evidence to support him has emerged. Has he changed his mind?Just the opposite. He appears to have become even more delusional: I think our side s been proven very strongly and everybody s talking about it and frankly, it should be discussed. Trump added,  We should find out what the hell is going on. Dickerson:  I m asking you because you don t want it to be fake news. I want to hear it from President Trump. Trump:  You don t have to ask me. You don t have to ask me. Dickerson:  Why not? Trump:  Because I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions. Dickerson points out that Trump s  own opinions  are kind of important because he s the president of the United States. At this point, Trump shuts down completely, ending the interview and running to his desk. The last shot the camera captures is Trump visibly fuming. Facts, it seems, irritate him.Featured image via CBS News",News,"May 1, 2017"

I think it s something that we ve looked at, and how that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story,  Priebus replied. So you think the President should be able to sue the New York Times for stories he doesn t like?  Karl continued to press. I think that newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news,  Priebus responded.  I am so tired. I don t think anyone would disagree with that,  Karl said.  It s about whether or not the President should have the right to sue them. And I already answered the question. I said this is something that is being looked at,  Priebus said.

 Trump Just Got WRECKED By Chelsea Clinton Over His Dumbass Slavery Remarks (TWEETS/VIDEO),"Anyone who has been to grade school is fully aware that Andrew Jackson died before a certain bloody conflict in which southerners fought their countrymen (former countrymen if you consider the Confederacy to be legitimate like many Trump supporters do) over the right to own other human beings, but Donald Trump has his own  alternative facts  about  swashbuckler  Jackson.Trump says he learned during a recent visit to Tennessee that  they love Andrew Jackson  down there, questioning whether Jackson, who owned 150 men, women, and children when he died in 1845, could have stopped the Civil War, which began in 1861, if he had  been a little bit later. I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart,  Trump told the Washington Post s Salena Zito. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said,  There s no reason for this.' Yes, according  to Trump, slave owner Andrew Jackson was angry about a war that began long after his death and totally would have acted against his own self-interest (slavery was the source of all of his money) to stop it if he hadn t been so dead. But he was mad. Then Trump wondered why the Civil War happened in the first place   a question appropriate coming from someone who thinks a hardcore slave owner would have stopped it: People don t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out? Fortunately,  Crooked Hillary s  daughter stepped up to provide him with the answer in a manner Trump may understand: under 140 characters:1 word answer: Slavery. Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children. https://t.co/Icg6puG2JZ  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 1, 2017Naturally, a Trump supporter made a snide remark that  Chelsea Clinton discovered Google    something Trump obviously did not do .BREAKING: Chelsea Clinton discovered Google https://t.co/Dpoi1DPNiS  Colin Carr (@colinthehogs) May 1, 2017 and promptly got stomped:Hi Colin   I've been to Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's home in Tennessee.

Appropriately, The Donald told Zito that his campaign was a lot like that of Jackson, who also called for  severe penalties  for  the circulation of incendiary publications.  Trump, who is exploring suing journalists for stories he does not like, just says  FAKE NEWS  because he s nowhere near as intelligent as the slave-owning former president he thinks would have stopped the Civil War.Naturally, Twitter loved watching Trump get dragged by the former First Daughter:@ChelseaClinton @IndependentlyE If you think Andrew Jackson was mad about the Civil War, you should have heard his thoughts on Vietnam.

 Neo-Nazi Rally Met With Strong Resistance By Local Town (DETAILS),"Neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered in Pikeville, Kentucky yesterday. They were met by scores of protesters who booed the group. Approximately 70 members of the Traditionalist Workers Party, the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement were heavily armed when they gathered at the courthouse in town.Pike County is a very white place. At least 98 percent of the people who live there are white. The area also went heavily for President Donald Trump. Eighty percent of the people there voted for Trump. These are the reasons that Pikeville was selected for the rally. The neo-Nazis and white supremacists are looking to become more politically relevant. They picked the area because they thought their message would appeal to the working class people who live there.Pikeville residents wanted no part of the message the rally organizers were trying to spread. Most of the rally supporters are not from Pikevillee. Lifelong Pikeville resident, Elizabeth White said,  We have no clue why they would even pick Pickville. Why don t they go disrespect their own homes, their own people, their own families? We need Trump to tell them to go back to their own place. There had been a lot of concern about the rally as recent protests around the country have turned violent. One protester was shot in the abdomen at an event in Seattle. Several people were stabbed at another event in Sacramento. Unlike Washington and California, which have strict gun control laws, Kentucky residents are allowed to carry weapons. Organizers of the Pikeville protest said beforehand that their people would be heavily armed. That led some to be concerned that violence at the protest could turn deadly.Luckily, none of that happened. The three hour rally included harsh words from both sides but was peaceful. As the protesters left town, people protesting the protest shouted,  Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out and stay the fuck out. You are not welcome here.

In it, he said there was a traitor at Fox News, and claimed to know who it is. After Bill O Reilly s ouster amid a sexual harassment scandal, people began saying that  they  were going to come after Hannity.Sure enough, Schlussel came forward saying that Hannity had been creepy with her. Hannity has repeatedly denied that he was even remotely inappropriate with her, and he and his followers seem to think that she s either an active participant in some grand conspiracy to shut down Fox News (and indeed, conservatives in general) entirely, or a pawn that  they  are using to take down every conservative there is.Honestly, he sounds too much like Trump, dropping saying on Twitter that he s got all this information and hinting that it could blow something wide open. Since he s a television personality, it s a little more likely that he s actually got something on someone (or a lot of someones), but then again he really does sound like Trump blowing hot air and this could wind up being a huge nothingburger.He shut down before he  said too much  to his Twitter audience, and is now simply saying,  stay tuned.  So he s hinting that he and his  team  are going to bust something wide open.

 Trump Administration Just Pressured Argentina Into Not Honoring Jimmy Carter With An Award,"The Trump administration explicitly requested that Argentine President Mauricio Macri delay honoring former Democratic President Jimmy Carter with an award. Marci planned to award Carter the Order of the Liberator General San Martin, the highest distinction in that country to a foreign person, but pressure from the Trump administration caused the honor to be delayed.Carter, who has been a critic of Trump s administration, was set to be honored by Argentina with the award which is the equivalent to America s Medal of Freedom.The Buenos Aires Herald reports:The Mauricio Macri administration reverted a decision to award former US president Jimmy Carter the Order of the Liberator General San Mart n   the maximum distinction that the country can give to a foreign personality  , under the pressure from US President Donald Trump s administration, CNN web site reported this week.The official tribute, which had already been approved by the foreign ministry and was published in the Official Gazette, was cancelled after receiving a specific request by the US government, which would have suggested it would be better to delay it. Carter was to be given the award for his work in promoting human rights during Argentina s last military dictatorship.According to CNN, an Argentinean official spoke on condition of anonymity and said the decision not to carry out the official delivery to Jimmy Carter was  to avoid conflicts  and to talk about matters of mutual interest between the two countries.CNN reports:The council that studies who to grant the distinction in the Chancellery of Argentina had approved the distinction to the former president for his work for peace and for his contribution to human rights during the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla when Carter was president of the United States.Trump has never been kind to his critics. Carter, on the other hand, is just a soul who, since leaving office, does charitable work for the needy.

 Fox News Shamefully Tries To Pass Off Obama’s Economic Achievements As Trump’s And Gets POUNDED For It,"Fox News made a desperate effort to convince everyone that Donald Trump is having more economic success than President Obama did, and it was shamefully dishonest.Trump has been touting his first 100 days as the best since World War II despite the fact that his first three months in office have been a complete embarrassment. No major legislation has been signed and Trump has issued a ton of destructive executive orders.Trump has been especially bragging about the economy, and Fox News tried to help him by comparing the economy after Trump s first 100 days with the economies under Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in their first 100 days.Dow Jones Industrial Average   Change after first 3 months in office: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/ve8RqFCByx  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Hourly wages after the President s first 3 months in office: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/KMjQHBTEEd  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Jobless rate after first 3 months: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/w8FzJJ9nXc  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Jobs added during first 2 months   Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/paBPjhfNiN  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017However, Fox News apparently ignored the fact that presidents inherit the state of the economy from their predecessors.For instance, President Obama inherited the Great Recession from President Bush, which is why the economy during his first 100 days stood in shambles as 1.5 million jobs were lost, unemployment topped 9 percent, and GDP dropped by 5 percent.In other words, President Obama was not responsible for those economic losses. But he did reverse them.After eight years in office, President Obama managed to bring down the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent, oversaw the longest streak of job creation on record and created 11.3 million jobs. Obama s best year for average GDP growth was in 2015 at 2.6 percent, but he did have many months that topped three percent. And he did all of this despite Republican obstruction at every turn.Donald Trump inherited Obama s economy, which is why he is touting it as his  achievement. The fact is, however, that we won t really know what Trump s economy will be until his policies take effect.So far, Trump has touted 500,000 jobs created, but that number is lower because he included the entire month of January, which rightfully should be in Obama s column. Trump s first three months in office also shows a GDP of 0.7 percent, far lower than the 4 percent he promised on the campaign trail.But again, Trump inherited Obama s economy, so he owes the positive growth rate that he is starting with to President Obama.When it comes to wages, Trump also doesn t have a leg to stand on. Many states passed laws increasing the minimum wage in 2015 and 2016, many of which went into effect this year. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour. Republicans refused to raise the federal wage during Obama s presidency. Trump himself opposes raising the minimum wage and his first Labor Secretary appointee supported killing minimum wage laws entirely. Republicans also still largely oppose the minimum wage. With that much opposition to minimum wage, including Trump s own opposition against it, he can hardly take credit for the minimum wage boosts that have occurred.These graphics were incredibly misleading and were clearly designed to make Trump look good at the expense of President Obama. But the tweets backfired spectacularly as Twitter users pointed out that they were not only lies, but demonstrated that Republican presidents inherit good economies from Democratic predecessors.@FoxNews What a stupid comparison  Obama inherited Bush s & Trump inherited Obama s. The rate of job growth has declined 50% (!) under Trump.

 Trump Could Get Primaried By A Horrified #NEVERTRUMP Republican In 2020 (DETAILS),"Ohio Governor and former Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is the one GOP elected official that is still not on the Trump Train. The other party loyalists have fallen in line, with the occasional criticisms from folks like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator John McCain (R-AZ). Infamously, Gov. Kasich did not attend the Republican National Convention even though it was in his home state and he was the sitting Governor. He also refused to praise or endorse Trump, or demand that others in his party do so. Now, it seems he may be looking at a way to take his party back from The Donald in 2020.Gov. Kasich s gubernatorial term will end in 2019, due to term limits. Therefore, he also will be looking to see what his next project will be. For now, he has been touring the talk show circuit promoting a book, and that has been the focus of these conversations. However, a man who was once an aide to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Ryan Williams, says of Kasich s 2020 prospects: Kasich is kind of in limbo   his time as governor will end when he s termed out, he doesn t have a path toward any other office in Ohio, and if Trump runs for reelection, I doubt he ll challenge him. That, however, does not mean that Kasich won t be throwing his hat into the 2020 ring. Williams goes on to say: But he s trying to keep his name in the mix in case President Trump decides not to run again   He, like many people, was counting on President Trump to lose in November, expecting to occupy a space in the effort to rebuild the party. But that evaporated the minute Trump won the election. Still, though, Kasich remains skeptical of Trump as president, and refuses to rule out challenging Trump. When asked, he ducks the question and essentially says he isn t running right now, he is promoting his book.In short, it seems that Kasich knows that Trump is terrible for the country, and really has no loyalty to the man. Further, with Trump s increasingly divisive policies and rhetoric continuing to rip at the fabric of the nation, he may feel the obligation to do what he can to unseat Trump in the primary and deny him the nomination a second time. In fact, when asked, Kasich said: What I m saying is it s unlikely, but I don t know what the future is going to bring for me, or what responsibility or obligation I might feel. The more Trump rips the nation apart, something tells me that obligation will feel a lot stronger by the time 2020 rolls around if Trump isn t impeached first.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2017"
 WATCH: Former Reagan Adviser Is Totally DISGUSTED By Trump’s Divisive Rally Speech,"Donald Trump treated Americans who oppose him as the enemy on Saturday and delivered the most divisive speech ever given by a president.Rather than attend the White House Correspondents  Dinner, Trump skipped the event instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania where he displayed the kind of pettiness and divisiveness that are unprecedented in presidential history. It s time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, and we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country,  Trump said, suggesting that Americans who oppose him are not patriots.Trump also bragged about the size of his crowd, despite the fact that it was not a  record,  and bragged about his  achievements  in his first 100 days even though he has been a complete failure who has done nothing but sign tyrannical executive orders and play golf while having no major legislation reach the Oval Office desk.Indeed, Trump s attempt to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act failed spectacularly and his executive orders on immigration have been blocked by the courts.Trump also treated a protester like shit at the rally, ordering security to  get him out of here,  as Nazis stood by in approval.Trump speech was not presidential. It was meant strictly to pander to his vile base of deplorable supporters who still supoort him no matter how much he lies or how much he destroys our country.And David Gergen, who served as an adviser to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, trashed Trump s  disturbing  speech. This was the most divisive speech I have ever heard from a sitting American president,  Gergen said.  Others may disagree about that. He played to his base and he treated his other listeners, the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or opposed him, he treated them basically as,  I don t give a damn what you think because you re frankly like the enemy.  I thought it was a deeply disturbing speech. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be impeached and everything he has done should be reversed and erased as if he never held office. He should also be put in prison for colluding with Russia, attempting to sabotage the United States, and violating the Constitution. Acting like a hateful and vengeful dictator should not be tolerated in this country.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2017"

This weekend he upped the ante a bit when he did an interview with John Dickerson for CBS s Face the Nation. Trump took the opportunity to bash the show to the show s host.After Dickerson called Trump out on some of his policy reversals over the course of the first 100 days of his presidency, this exchange happened: It s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge. It s very funny when the fake media goes out   which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say is you,  said Trump.

 Trump Fan Just Got His Pride DEMOLISHED By A 7th Grader In Epic Letter To A Newspaper,"A Trump supporter thought he was clever when he wrote a letter to the editor of his local paper, the Winchester Star, criticizing  Hate has no home here  signs that were popping up in his area. The signs feature the phrase written in a number of languages and should be seen as a positive thing by everyone, but Trump supporters are filled to the brim with hatred, so self-described  50-year Tea Partier became  triggered  and wrote an angry letter full of so much whining  that it would cause notorious white grievance princess and former Blaze personality Tomi Lahren to scream  SNOWFLAKE  for six hours in an unhinged Facebook video post if a liberal wrote it.Natale posed a number of incredibly stupid questions he didn t expect to be answered   but then a 7th grader by the name of Luke Macannuco answered them and delivered a smackdown so hard that the Tea Partier might think twice about saying or writing something this stupid again (Oh, who are we kidding? He won t). I read, with great interest, Mr. John Natale s colossal misunderstanding of the  Hate Has No Home Here  signs. Natale s first mistake was claiming the signs read,  Hate has no place in this home .  the teen s letter begins.  Mr. Natale is incorrectly assuming that the owners of the sign are finding it necessary to state that there is no hate in their home. But, as the American flag depicted on the sign signifies, the posters are referencing the entire U.S.A., a country that does not tolerate hate in spite of its current leadership. Those people who have chosen to place a  Hate Has No Home Here  sign on their lawn are standing behind their belief that the country should be free of hate. The teen then addressed the meat of Natale s moronic writings, and it is the best thing you will read for quite some time  until you see what came after it, that is:Mr. Natale also lists questions that have remained unanswered, so it is my duty to define his burning inquiries:1. Question:  Who are the haters that you, the sign owner, are referring to?  Answer: Bigots who are trying to take away protections for transgender students, deport refugees and build a very expensive wall to keep illegal immigrants out (which is completely pointless and not helping your cause, but I digress).2. Question:  What, or whom, do the haters hate?  Answer: Perfectly innocent human beings who happen to be different from the haters.3. Question:  What is the evidence that there is significant hate in our community?  Answer: Me getting called homosexual slurs by students and adults alike.4. Question:  Obviously, you are so morally superior that you may declare everyone who disagrees with you a hater (side note: this first part is a statement, not a question). Where, when, and how did you become the Lord High Decider of Morality?  Answer: Never. We just put a lawn sign down. Calm down, dude.This is enough to have most right-wingers peeing themselves like a couple of Russian prostitutes on a certain billionaire s Moscow hotel bed, but our hero wasn t done:As I stated previously, the signs are not talking exclusively about Winchester. The signs are about the whole United States. They also aren t implying you are a hater if you disagree; where did you get that idea? Also, Mr. Natale, if you re going to ask us to do you a favor and take the signs down, do humanity a favor and take your Trump signs down. Finally, if you are going to say signs exhibit  snowflake sensitivity,  take a moment to think about how you are writing an angry letter to a newspaper about a lawn sign.And the crowd went wild:@segalmr @fuggirls  If ur going to think signs display  snowflake sensitivity    think about how you are writing a letter to a newspaper about a sign.  pic.twitter.com/5cOopDqQb0  Sela Lewis (@SelaNehanda) April 29, 2017@segalmr @AlJavieera Controlled burn.

 Schumer Breaks It Down: Explains Why Trump Hasn’t Accomplished Sh*t (VIDEO),"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer broke things down on Sunday and explained why it is that Donald Trump hasn t been able to accomplish squat so far.Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Schumer gave a scathing review of Trump s first 100 days, which he said had  hardly been a success.  He laid into Trump for his litany of broken promises, including his failed health care bill and decision to add more monsters to the swamp rather than draining it. There s been promise after promise that s been either unfulfilled or broken,  he said. The bottom line is very simple: the president, if he works with us, particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure, we can work. But on the issues so far, taxes and healthcare, he doesn t consult us at all. According to Schumer, Trump comes up with a plan that s very hard right  and then tells Democrats that supporting the plan is the only  way to be bipartisan. That s not how America works,  Schumer said.The Senate minority leader then scorched Trump on his failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He pointed out that Trump didn t need a single Democrat to vote for his bill in order to pass it. And it still failed miserably. He s not governing from the middle, he s governing from the hard right. That s why his regime has had hardly any major successes, with the exception of Gorsuch. If he changes, we can work together. But he can t just dictate what he wants,  Schumer said. The country doesn t work my way or the highway. Trump, for his part, spent the weekend attacking Democrats, Schumer in specific. On Saturday, Trump slammed Schumer as  a bad leader.  On Sunday, he said that without a leader,  Democrats  have become the party of obstruction.  He then continued that theme during an interview with Face The Nation on Sunday morning.You can watch Schumer s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2017"
 Trump Goes BALLISTIC As White House Correspondents Dinner Continues Without Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may be one of the most bitter, petty people on the planet. Several weeks ago, Trump announced that he would not be attending the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington because he couldn t handle the media s criticism. As the WH Correspondents Dinner finally took place last night without Trump, he basically threw a fit during a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania because the event was held  without the president. If Trump expected the annual event to be canceled because the country s commander-in-chief decided to be a temperamental man-baby, he was proven wrong last night   and obviously couldn t handle the fact that the media and several celebrities still wanted to go. In an unhinged, unpresidential rant, Trump blasted the media and all in attendance of the WH Correspondents Dinner.Trump lied and said he could not possibly more thrilled  to be far away from the  Washington swamp , where the reporters were consoling each other in a hotel ballroom.  Trump then bragged about the size of his crowds in comparison to the dinner before pointing to the cameras and saying they would actually rather be here.  Trump s delusional fans loved every second of it, and were soon chanting  CNN sucks , encouraging Trump to go off even more on  fake news . He said: They would love to be with us here tonight, but they re trapped at the dinner which will be very, very boring. With the encouragement from the crowd, Trump then recycled all his usual attacks, such as Hillary Clinton and the New York Times   a tactic Trump regularly uses because he isn t intelligent enough to talk about his actual policies.If there was ever a speech that displayed just how insecure and small-minded Trump is, it was this one.

 Donald Trump Learned A New Word And It Should Give You Chills (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t enjoying his time as President. In a series of interviews marking the first 100 days of his presidency, he s done an awful lot of whining and complaining, including saying that the job is much harder than he thought.One of the reasons the job is so hard for him is that he s not a dictator, as much as he d like to be one. His powers are limited by a document called the Constitution and that frustrates the hell out of him, even though he has an entirely Republican federal government.In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump appeared to have learned a new word, and he used it four times in reference to the Constitution. That word was  archaic,  and in his context, it was particularly disconcerting because it signaled his desire to completely do away with the constraints of the Constitution and with our system of checks and balances.Remember when White nationalist House stooge and millennial most likely to be punched Steven Miller said that  that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned?  A collective chill went up the spines of thinking Americans. Be prepared to feel that chill again. Here s what Trump said on Friday.In an interview with Fox News to mark the 100-day mark, he declared himself  disappointed  with congressional Republicans, despite his many  great relationships  with them.He blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to US governance.  It s a very rough system,  he said.  It s an archaic system   It s really a bad thing for the country. Here s the video:Mostly, Trump wants to get rid of the filibuster. He has no authority whatsoever over the rules of the Senate, and while the Senate leadership could change the rules, in theory, it would be quite short-sighted because it would mean that the next time Democrats have even a slim majority, Republicans would be powerless to get anything accomplished or to stop a Democratic agenda.When President Obama wasn t able to get past the filibuster, Donald Trump called him weak and ineffectual. Now that the loafer is on Trump s foot, it s the Constitution s fault. Do you have chills yet?Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 30, 2017"
 Trump’s Favorite New Dictator Just Cut Off Access To Wikipedia,"The Turkish government has blocked access to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. When people throughout the country try to access the site, all they will see is a swirly symbol until they see a message that the connection to the server has timed out. Turkey was recently subject to a failed coup attempt, and in the aftermath President Erdo an used the incident to seize greater powers over the government, becoming a dictator. Trump praised this.The official reason the Turkish government has given is that the site,  has started acting as part of the circles who carry out a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena, rather than being cooperative in fight against terror.  This is according to a statement by Turkish ministry officials. There have been articles posted to Wikipedia that equate the Turkish government with various terror groups.The Turkey Blocks organization that watches for these kinds of blocks announced the government actions against Wikipedia. Johnny Wales, the founder of Wikipedia took to Twitter to voice his objections. He posted,  Access to information is a fundamental human right. The Turkish people I will always stand with you to fight for this right. While other sites are working normally right now, the Turkish government has used its power to cut off access to other sites in the past. For example, it blocked access to YouTube for several months in 2014. This was in response to a video the site showed of a meeting in Syria on security. The year before that, the government shut off access to a variety of social media channels such as Twitter and Facebook due to bomb attacks or widespread protests.Last November, limitations were placed on access to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.Some clever internet users have been able to get around the blocks by using VPNs. Increasingly, the government has been finding ways to keep these users from accessing banned sites.The government admits that from  time to time for security reasons we can use such measures  These are temporary measures. Once the danger is passed, everything returns to normal.  This is according to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2017"

In just 100 days, Trump has torched that tacit agreement.Neo-Nazis were also spotted in the crowd. They ve been a regular feature of Trump rallies in recent months, including proudly filming themselves give Nazi  sieg heil  salutes during a Berkeley march.

 Elizabeth Warren Was Asked Why She Went To Trump’s Inauguration. Her Response Will TERRIFY Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has a major issue with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). This was apparent during his entire presidential campaign, when he basically had a meltdown every time Warren dared to criticize him or call him out on his bullsh*t. Trump had every reason to fear Warren   she was one of his most outspoken critics, and it made Americans love and respect her even more. She has a huge following and was highly influential in her role in the anti-Trump movement, so it was surprising to many that she attended Trump s inauguration. But now, we know why she went.Several Democrats couldn t bear to see Trump get sworn in, and we can t blame them. Warren, however, made it a point to show up despite the fact that Trump insulted her many times, nicknaming her  Pocahontas . On Bill Maher s Real Time, Warren told Maher just what she was thinking by going to an inauguration that she clearly did not want to see happen. She said: I went to Trump s inauguration. I watched. I wanted to see it. I wanted it burned into my eyes. My view on this was that if there were ever going to be a moment when I was like,  Uhh, I m too tired to get up,  all I ve got to do is close my eyes and I m like,  Oh God, I m up! I m up! I m up! I m ready! I m back in the fight. Warren shared the sentiments of most Americans when she said that the day after Trump s inauguration was when  the world changed    but she encouraged Americans to stay positive. While Trump had been sworn in, the historic Women s March also took place that weekend. Warren said that Trump s election helped Americans find their voices and passion: It will be about the day we made our voices heard. It s clear that watching Trump s inauguration helped light a fire inside Warren, and she s using it as fuel to keep fighting Trump and the GOP. This is going to terrify Trump, and she knows it.

 WATCH: Rob Reiner Destroys Team Trump Claims that Obama Should Be Blamed for Flynn,"All week, Team Trump has been trying to push all the blame for Michael Flynn s actions onto the Obama administration. Despite the fact that Flynn did not start working for foreign governments until after he was fired, they still think they can say it is all Barack Obama s fault. Rob Reiner is having none of it.This morning on AM Joy, Reiner said: This man who is the head of our country is a pathological liar and everybody around him is lying. There s no way to other way to look at this thing. Not only did we know about Michael Flynn, there were a number of articles, there was a letter written by the House Oversight Committee. It was well-known what Michael Flynn was doing, he was fired by Barack Obama, so that is clear. The one thing that they have been successful at so far is obfuscating the biggest single story that is permeating this country right now, and that is the invasion of a foreign power, a hostile foreign power into our democracy. And the Michael Flynn story, aside from the fact that he was taking money from Turkey, from Russia, from places and clearly that s a criminal behavior, the main part of the story, and something that we haven t even talked about is: why? Why with the White House knowing full well that this is who he was, they still appointed him National Security Adviser? At first the gang that can t shoot straight looked like it was incompetent because they may not have bothered to do any vetting of Flynn before letting him take over as the National Security Advisor. Now it looks like they either did not understand the law or the Constitution and the rules the military needs to adhere to or they knew the rules and didn t care that Flynn broke them. Either way, putting Flynn in such a sensitive post, with access to the most classified data, was never a good idea. While Flynn was getting the same briefing as the President-Elect, he penned an op-ed for The Hill urging more support for Turkey. When that piece was written, Flynn was receiving money from the Turkish government.Featured image via Amanda Edwards/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Team Trump Knew Flynn Broke The Law And Hired Him Anyway (DETAILS),"While most Americans did not know about Michael Flynn s ties to Turkey, Team Trump did. When they were vetting the former general, they did learn of Flynn s work for both Turkey and Russia. They knew he had violated the law and the U.S. Constitution and they hired him to be the National Security Advisor anyway.MSNBC s Rachel Maddow said this on her show on Friday night,  NBC News has learned from sources close to the Trump-Russia investigation that both the Trump transition and the White House did do a background check on Flynn.  She went on to say that the vetting Team Trump did of Flynn was done  very casually. The new reporting by NBC News mirrors the claims Flynn has been making for some time that he and his lawyers were upfront with the vetting team about the lobbying he was doing on behalf of the Turkish government.For its part, the White House has taken to blaming the Obama administration. Flynn worked as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). His job at the DIA did require he receive a top secret clearance but it is important to note that he was fired from that job in 2014 (he started there in 2011), this was a full year before he was scheduled to retire.This week, Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated that the transition team relied on the vetting that had been done by the Obama Administration. The timing of this is important to note because Flynn did not start his consulting work until after he left the DIA. The vetting he received prior to that role, which is what gave him his clearance would not have shown his ties to Turkey or Russia because that work hadn t happened yet.Members of the military are barred from working for foreign governments for life, unless they receive Congressional approval. The reason is that they can be called back to duty at any time and working for a foreign government could cause a conflict of interest.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Golf Addicted 70-Year-Old Man Says He ‘Couldn’t Care Less About Golf’,"Just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease, former reality show star Donald Trump does not think he has a problem. The alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the U.S., and that s probably because he, too, suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial. Donald Trump needs treatment, but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job.The amateur president has spent 31 days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties, including 19 visits to his golf clubs. He s been on the job for only 100 days. In contrast, former President Barack Obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office. Obama s first golf game was on April 26th, 2009.Still yet, as addicts do, Trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties, saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does, according to The Hill. I have a lot of property. So if I go to my clubs like in New Jersey, they ll say,  Oh he is going to play golf.  I am not going to play golf,  Trump said in an interview on Fox News.  I couldn t care less about golf. Well, he sure did care when Obama played golf, though. In fact, there are dozens of rage-tweets from Trump about Obama playing golf.Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 But I have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets,  Trump added.What Trump means is that it costs him  nothing.  We, the taxpayers, though, are paying big time. It costs us about $3 million a pop every time he visits his Mar-a-Lago resort. Meanwhile, every visit to a Trump-owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency.Trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his Trump Tower residence in New York because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip. But, he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several White Houses, instead of one. For example, the security for Melania Trump in New York reportedly costs the city s Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect her and her son. The Secret Service had to request an additional $60 million in funding to protect Trump and his family. I love New York, but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up Fifth Avenue and they close up 56th Street   and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there,  he said.Trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure. They are expensive to secure. Trump s frequent visits to his Florida resort have been a financial burden on the county. It would be much better if people would understand that I could go other places that I have,  Trump said.  But then they hit me for relaxing. And I don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because I am working hard and I am working hard for the people. Addiction, whether it be from drugs, alcohol, sex or golfing, is not a prejudiced disease. It can affect you whether you are black, white, Orange, rich or poor, pay your taxes, or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Bill Maher Just Dropped A Truth Bomb About Trump Voters That Every Liberal Needs To Hear (VIDEO),"We on the left are all wondering why, out of the vast field of GOP candidates, Donald Trump roared to the nomination, toppling traditional candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even hard-right bigots like Ted Cruz. No, they picked The Donald, and no matter how vulgar he was, how bigoted he was, how dangerously unhinged he was, they still picked him. Then, they got him elected president, to the horror of most Americans and to the delight of that swath of people who were so entranced by Trump from the moment he rode down that escalator.Well, now, we are 100 days in, and the Trump presidency is just as chaotic and terrifying as we all knew it would be. Trump is incompetent and dangerous, as well as an embarrassment on the world stage. Yet, his voters are sticking with him. And Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time, thinks he knows why. Remember when Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of New York City s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters? That s likely true. And Maher has the answer as to why. He said in his  New Rules  segment on Friday night: Trump supporters aren t changing their minds because the problem isn t in the mind. It s lower. It s emotional. He could have Ann Frank s skeleton in his closet. They d all vote for him again. He continued, letting liberals know why facts, vulgarity, incompetence, and any other outrage Trump might commit matters not to his devoted followers: I think it s a gut feeling that the world has changed and they don t like it. Trump is going to change it back to the way it was. Maher then went on to mock Trump voters in a hillbilly affect, saying things like: I ain t no racist, but why does American need to have a black Santa Claus? And did I mention Bruce Jenner has tits now? Returning to his normal voice, Maher explained: I think I speak for most liberals when I say, I don t care about black Santa. I don t think it s going to make the Little Drummer Boy start cutting himself. But to Trump voters, making Santa black is unthinkable. It d be like making Jesus Middle Eastern. Maher concluded, summing up just why Trump voters put him in the White House, despite the fact that he is clearly the last person who should be president: This is why building that stupid wall is still a key issue for them. It represents keeping out not just immigrants but everything that is new and different and scary and unfamiliar. And this is just it. These people don t care what Trump does. He ll make America comfortable for them again, in their minds. There will be no more religions besides Christianity, there will be no LGBTQ rights, black people and other minorities will know their places, women would be in the kitchen and the bedroom where they belong rather than in the boardroom, and white men will control everything again.This is about cultural anxiety and bigotry. It really was, as Van Jones says, a white lash. Therefore, don t try and woo Trump voters away from him with facts. They seriously don t care.Watch Bill Maher s very important message below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2017"
" Desperate For Guests, Fox News’ O’Reilly Replacement Invites Fabio On To Bash Liberals (VIDEO)","Until today s episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight, this was widely considered the most pathetic thing to ever happen on Fox News:After today, this could very well be the next contender:Fabio: Releasing inmates early will lead to more crime. #Tucker pic.twitter.com/2PZeFb9Z3W  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017That would be male model Fabio spewing a word salad about liberals destroying California before getting sidetracked into a protracted rant about the legal system. Fabio has come to the conclusion that America s world record prison population is actually too small. Why is he an expert? His house was broken into once. Tucker Carlson treats Fabio s fact-free musings on criminality as sage advice. Fox News  social media team thought it was such a clever line that they went ahead and promoted it on Twitter.Things are not going well for Fox News.Tucker Carlson replaces Bill O Reilly after the Fox icon was fired for sexual misconduct that spanned decades. Tucker s show has so far managed to retain much of O Reilly s audience, but it s taken less than a week for things to start coming apart at the seams. By inviting disreputable guests like Fabio and Ann Coulter, Tucker has shown he ll aim to be more of a Sean Hannity than a serious newsman. Any chance that Fox News might try to clean itself up has already gone out the window.Sean Hannity, meanwhile, has become completely unglued since losing his boss Roger Ailes and his co-worker Bill O Reilly to sexual harassment violations. Already unstable, Hannity has lost the thread entirely. He s now the paranoid guy wearing a tinfoil hat on the bus.G be i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that's the total end of the FNC as we know it. Done. Best Sean https://t.co/W3BJ2wjzRD  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 27, 2017Somebody HIGH UP AND INSIDE FNC is trying to get an innocent person fired. And Gabe I KNOW WHO it is. Best Sean https://t.co/W3BJ2wjzRD  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 27, 2017O Reilly s other possible replacement, longtime collaborator Jesse Watters, managed to earn himself an O Reilly-esque impromptu  vacation  when he made a sex joke about Ivanka Trump complete with a gross pantomime.I just noticed Jesse Watters jerked his hand up and down slightly as he joked that he liked how Ivanka holds a microphone. pic.twitter.com/I332JcgoMx  David Mack (@davidmackau) April 26, 2017Watters, already a known racist, made his Ivanka sex jokes just days after his former boss was ousted for sexual harassment. Stupid never learns.And then there is the pending lawsuit in which several black former Fox employees allege Fox executives made them armwrestle  for entertainment  along with other humiliating activities.According to the plaintiffs  attorneys, Slater demanded that black employees hold  arm wrestling matches  with white female employees in her office, just down the hall from Ailes s office on the 2nd floor of Fox headquarters.  Forcing a black woman employee to  fight  for the amusement and pleasure of her white superiors is horrifying. This highly offensive and humiliating act is reminiscent of Jim Crow era battle royals,  the letter says, referring to the practice of paying black men to fight blindfolded at carnivals for white spectators  entertainment.What a healthy environment Fox News has created for itself. No wonder they are struggling to find a celebrity more reputable than Fabio to come on their shows and shill for Trump.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Dem Senator Goes On HEARTWRENCHING Tweetstorm About Gun Violence During Trump’s NRA Speech,"Donald the Trump went to speak at the NRA s annual meeting today, and his speech was utterly ridiculous. He borrowed a lot of what he said from the rhetoric of an extreme right-wing, anti-government group known as the Three Percenters, including saying that there will be another revolution if the government finds ways to regulate guns.Because that s what the people from the group that donated $30 million to Trump s campaign want to hear. Whenever there s another violent tragedy and guns are involved, we get to hear all about how it happened because not enough people were armed, because it was a gun-free zone, etc. These people think nothing, care nothing, for the lives lost due to gun violence. And Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has had it.So he went on a devastating tweetstorm today, complete with pictures of children and young adults who have died at the hands of senseless gun violence.

 Obama Just CRUSHED Trump’s Lies About His “Winning” Presidency In The BEST Way (DETAILS),"If there s one person that Donald Trump can t STAND to have criticizing him, it s his predecessor, Barack Obama   and Obama just attacked Trump in a way that was pretty damn genius.Last night, at a private event in Manhattan, the former POTUS reminded America of the amazing leader they lost when his second term was up. As Trump continuously blasts him and takes credit for the many accomplishments that he worked hard for, Obama reminded the audience just how resilient and successful Obamacare is   by pointing out that Obamacare now has a higher approval rating than the current president.According to CNN: As Republicans in Washington sputtered again this week in their efforts to undo the law, Obama noted to an audience in midtown Manhattan that  the Affordable Care Act has never been more popular   and it s more popular than the current president,  according to a person in the room who paraphrased the comments. We couldn t have thought of a better way to insult Trump and the Republican Party, especially as their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act continue to be a disastrous, embarrassing failure.Obamacare, which Trump repeatedly referred to as a  disaster  and  jobs killer , isn t going anywhere thanks to its popularity and the GOP s failure to do any better. Considering that Trump s approval ratings are at a historic low despite its honeymoon period, it s unlikely that any major piece of legislation that he tries to pass will be accepted.It s nice to see that after all the backlash and attacks from Trump and the Republican Party, Obama is reveling in his hard work. The knowledge that his health care bill could not be taken down so easily and is now more appreciated by Americans than the idiot who replaced him in the White House, must be satisfying as hell and Obama has earned the right to gloat about it.Featured image via Zach Gibson / Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Florida Student In Deep Sh*t After Trying To Sell Black Classmates Into Slavery On Craigslist,"Donald Trump hasn t even been President 100 days and already some are apparently forming the idea that it s cool to post slave sale ads on Craigslist.A Florida high school student snapped a photo of two of his African-American classmates sitting at their desks at Fleming Island High School. In a post geotagged to Fleming Island Plantation, a neighborhood in the town, the unnamed student posted an ad to Craigslist: Two healthy negro slavegals for sale. Good condition and hard work ethic! If you need another pair of hands around the farm/house, you re in luck! One of the victims  sister tweeted an image of the ad:This is what happened to my sister (in the blue) who attends Fleming Island High School in Jacksonville, FL. This is NOT OKAY AT ALL!!! pic.twitter.com/vhhGyZZ5aP  yossiana (@yossiana22) April 27, 2017 I never thought somebody would do this to me. I had friends texting and calling me,  senior Skye Fefee, one of the students in the photo, says.  Everyone started tagging me in the post, and then my mom saw it and was disturbed by it  I was really upset about it because Fleming Island is known for racial slurs. This school year someone wrote on the toilets,  whites only. The student who posted the ad was suspended for a meager ten days, but was referred to an alternative school by the principal. The school board will ultimately decide whether to remove the student, send him to alternative school permanently, or expel him.Superintendent Addison Davis issued a statement in response encouraging parents to take the time to inform their kids that it s not cool at all to sell your classmates into slavery: We do not tolerate this type of behavior and we are disheartened that any of our students would be subject to discrimination. Fleming Island High School administration and district leadership are working together to create a schoolwide plan of action to strengthen the climate and culture while celebrating the school s diversity. We encourage parents and guardians to take the time to talk to their child about this important matter. Feefee says she wants to see the person who posted this expelled, adding that the administration  doesn t pay attention  to this sort of behavior regularly.Donald Trump s election has allowed racists to express themselves as never before, as he has filled his administration with white supremacists, Nazis, and other assorted fascists, racists, and utter scumbags.What a great example for our kids.Watch a news report below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 28, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Rips Michael Flynn for His Hypocrisy,"This has not been a good week for Michael Flynn. According to a letter from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Flynn never received permission to receive permission for the monies he was paid by both Russian and Turkish governments.The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 9, clause 8, as interpreted in Comptroller General opinions and by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, prohibits receipt of consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria, or salary by all retired military personnel, officer and enlisted, regular and reserve, from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained. Consent is provided by Congress under 37 U.S.C. 908, which requires advance approval from the relevant service secretary and the Secretary of State before accepting employment, consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria, or salary from a foreign government.   Accordingly, if you are ever in a position where you would receive an emolument from a foreign government or from an entity that might be controlled by a foreign government, be sure to obtain advance approval from the Army prior to acceptance.  (emphasis in original)To recap: Flynn broke the law, lied about why he was fired and was never really vetted by the Trump administration prior to becoming the President s National Security Advisor. He says he was fired from the military because he called the enemies of the United States  jihadis.  The military says he was fired for not listening to orders, being abusive to staff and going against policy. He was warned in 2014 to not accept payments from Russia or Turkey but he went ahead and did it anyway.If you have any doubts as to why the Emoluments Clause is so important, you only have to read the op-ed Flynn wrote in November 2016 about Turkey. While he was on the Turkish payroll he wrote,  We need to adjust our foreign policy to recognize Turkey as a priority. We need to see the world from Turkey s perspective. The good news is Flynn is out of the administration. Now the Trump administration needs to release everything it used to vet him.Featured image via Kevin Hagen/Getty Images.",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Man Attacks Lexington Student With Machete For Not Being A Republican,"A student at Transylvania University was injured she was attacked by a man wielding a machete. The attacker, identified as Mitchell Adkins, entered a cafe on campus and started asking people what their political party affiliation was. In addition to the machete, he had a bag that was filled with knives. Mark Barnard, the police chief, said the victim was taken to the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Classes at the university were cancelled for the rest of the day.Of the victim, Transylvania University President Seamus Carey said she  is safe and her family is with her at the University of Kentucky Hospital. Adkins, who may be a former student at the school, was also taken to the hospital to be evaluated. A guy came in, banged something, a hatchet or an ax, on the table and said  the day of reckoning has come. He asked somebody what their political affiliation was, they said  Republican  and the guy said  you are safe.  And then I realized what was going on and started getting people out,  said Tristan Reynolds, another student who was in the coffee shop at the time of the attack. He reported that there were between 30 and 40 people in the cafe at the time.  We started to scatter and then very, very quickly campus security was getting everybody sheltered and secure. They were very on it. The cafe is popular with students. They like to go there for breakfast and coffee, according to Reynolds, who is the editor of The Rambler, the Transylvania student paper. One thing that sets this cafe apart is its open floor plan.The coffee shop, which is inside the Glenn Building, has an open floor plan and is a popular spot for students to get coffee and breakfast, Reynolds said. He is the editor-in-chief of the Transylvania student newspaper, The Rambler, and was with other members of the paper s staff at the cafe at time of the attack.Lexington police, along with the security officers for the University of Transylvania, were given active shooter training a few weeks ago. This exercise also went onto how to lock down sites and the best way to keep students, faculty and staff safe. Seamus Carey, the president of the university said,  They ve always been amazing and today they proved their worth again. They were there immediately. They saved what could have been a much more disastrous situation and I d also like to commend the Lexington police for responding immediately as well. Adkins has a history of complaining about discrimination against conservatives. He wrote a letter to the student paper in which he said,  Being a Republican in this school makes me such a minority that I ve had to face discrimination on a daily basis. Transylvania is a predominantly Democratic school. I m always happy to listen to other people s opinions, but as soon as I give my own, I m called a  bigot,  an  a -le,  some even go as far as  fascist Nazi. ",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Watch Reporter’s Face As He Recounts Trump Going Full-Narcissist During Oval Office Interview (VIDEO),"On his 100th day in office, a listless Donald Trump sat down with Reuters to talk about his accomplishments. As fate would have it, Trump had just been told that two servicemembers had been killed in an anti-ISIS raid in Afghanistan, his re-re-remade healthcare bill was dead on arrival, and his plans to build a wall were going up in flames. But he had other things on his mind. For Donald Trump, every day is November 8th, 2016.To the three reporters, Trump passed out a printed picture of the United States, with counties he won in the election colored in red.More than five months after his victory and two days shy of the 100-day mark of his presidency, the election is still on Trump s mind. Midway through a discussion about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map. Here, you can take that, that s the final map of the numbers,  the Republican president said from his desk in the Oval Office, handing out maps of the United States with areas he won marked in red.  It s pretty good, right? The red is obviously us. Later he posed for photos, insisting on holding up the map. (Note: Trump s White House photographer, who formerly worked in the Bush White House, likes to take pictures of Trump from really far away. It s unclear exactly why.)So this happened today  pic.twitter.com/UqtgvoyIRj  SalenaZito (@SalenaZito) April 28, 2017here's a pic from reuters of Trump with the electoral maps he showed to reporters yesterday pic.twitter.com/1X3edpeJDQ  Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) April 28, 2017Reporter Jeff Mason recounted the surreal moment the President of the United States interrupted questions on North Korea and China to brag about a map of the election he had won more than 5 months earlier. His expressions cycle from disbelief to pity to humor and back to disbelief.CNN s Chris Cuomo asked the reporters the obvious question: Is Trump really so insecure that he still feels he has to prove that he won the election? Mason said it could be a lot of factors (all troubling from a mental health standpoint): I think that s a good question and it s hard for me to answer that. I think he just wanted to relish in the fact that this map, uh, looks good for him and he said  the red is obviously us  and the red are areas in the country that he won. So he s just very proud of it. And whether that s rooted in a sense that he still has to prove that he won or that he s upset that the media got it wrong in terms of the predictions ahead of time it s hard for me to say. Trump, a 70-year-old billionaire, craves the attention one might give a child for a project they made in art class. He may as well have asked the reporters to pin the map up on their refrigerator doors.Making it even more clear that Trump is suddenly feeling very small, he later admitted that being president is really hard, and it s not as fun as his old life. The fact that running the country wouldn t be as easy as being a semi-retired billionaire and reality tv show host was something that apparently never occurred to Trump prior to being elected. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. At least he s got his map.Featured image via CNN",News,"April 28, 2017"
" While Scott Baio’s Battle With Erin Moran’s Family Continues, His Wife Defends His ‘Size’","Erin Moran s family members must have really upset former  Happy Days  star Scott Baio and his wife because now Chachi s penis size is being defended.Trump fan Scott Baio weighed in on Moran s death, saying he was  not completely shocked  by his former co-star s death and added that if  you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die. I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself. However, Moran died from cancer, not drugs. And Baio s ignorance about drug addiction is stunning.So, Moran s brother Tony and her cousin, Roy, wasn t too pleased. Baio was called a  d*ck head  and  a scumbag coward piece of shit! On Facebook, Tony Moran wrote:A special shout out to Scott Baio. I already went on Twitter about you. I hope it finds you. You and my lil sis had a very very brief fling. She dumped you. 2 reasons. 1. She told me that you were more like a lil girl and not a man. 2. She told me that you were tiny. Ya know. Barely a man in the man region. True story! Scott, I d advise you to get on your knees and pray you never run into me.In what The Daily Beast notes as an  inability to know when to maintain a dignified silence,  Renee Baio came to the defense of her husband s penis size.Renee tweeted,  Why would a sister tell her brother about the size of boyfriend s manhood? Creepy at best. SB was a playboy for a reason!  We took a screenshot knowing she might delete it or lock down her account and as a surprise to no one ever, her tweets are now protected.So now Mrs. Baio is calling Erin Moran  creepy.  When her defense of Chachi s penis size is, but he  was a playboy 4 a reason,  then she is bringing his manhood into question again. Sometimes silence is the better option. Chachi never grew up and he apparently married a child. Both of them are staunch Trump supporters, by the way. Chachi loves Trump. As for Renee, the E-list celebrity s wife, she s as much of an idiot as her husband. She s taken to Facebook to launch rants in defense of her husband by using homophobic slurs against a website then declaring that Scott has  more class in his piss than all of you all.

" Rich A**hole Ran For President Thinking It Would Be An ‘Easy’ Job, Gets HUMILIATED By Reality","Donald Trump seriously thought having the hardest job on Earth would be  easy.  LOL!After 100 days on the job, many of which Trump spent at his lavish Florida resort playing golf, Trump stated during an interview with Reuters that he thought the presidency would be an easy job that he could just sail through.Trump complained about how his current job requires him to do much more work than he is accustomed to doing and waxed nostalgic about his life before taking over the White House. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going,  Trump said.  This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. This demonstrates just how woefully unprepared Trump was to become president. And it certainly shows.After all, Trump s administration has been a complete failure only three months in.His unconstitutional executive actions on immigration have been blocked by federal judges. His effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act went down in flames, much to the relief of millions of Americans. His environmental record is a disaster. He still denies science and is cutting funding to scientific agencies and organizations. He has alienated our allies while continuing to praise Russia and Putin. He is embroiled in an ever-growing scandal. And he has turned America into a laughingstock around the world.And that s just the tip of the iceberg as Trump threatens World War III over North Korea and a government shutdown looms because he refuses to negotiate with Democrats.The only president who has had an arguably worse first 100 days is William Henry Harrison and that s only because he died 30 days into his presidency. But at least he didn t embarrass the nation and destroy it from within.The fact is that being president is a tough job. It s also a lonely job. There s a reason why presidents go grey during their years in office. It s a stressful job. Every decision made affects the nation and the world. Maybe if Trump spent less time golfing, tweeting, and watching cable news he would know that being president means working with Congress, including Democrats. Instead, Trump would rather act like a dictator and just sign executive orders between tee times and whine when he doesn t get his way.Clearly, Trump doesn t know what hard work is.Featured Image: Tom Pennington/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Team Trump Refuses to Turn Over Key Vetting Documents on Flynn,"What did he know and when did he know it? These iconic questions are swirling around President Donald Trump and his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. With the new revelations that received money from both the Russian and Turkish governments, it appears Team Trump is either about as incompetent as many critics believe or liked Flynn enough to overlook clear violations of the U.S. Constitution and the law. The U.S. Constitution prohibits members of the military from taking any money from foreign governments. Despite this, Flynn registered as a foreign agent after he left the administration. No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state. Even retired members of the military can be called back at any time so it is important that there be no conflict of interest. As a lobbyist for Turkey, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, it is hard to see how Flynn could have anything but such a conflict. Both the Department of Defense and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight are looking into Flynn. The problem is that Team Trump is refusing to turn over the documents they used to vet the former general.Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was not happy with this situation. The ranking member on that committee said,  I honestly do not understand why the White House is covering up for Michael Flynn. It makes the American people think the White House has something to hide. There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow. For its part, the Department of Defense s inspector general is looking into Flynn s association with Russia and Turkey. He had been warned by the agency against taking these payments.The White House has had several explanations for why it is not turning over what they used to vet Flynn. They claim they do not have anything that was used before January 20. They then claim that the documents they have are  too sensitive  to turn over. When all of that didn t work, they fell back on an old standby. They blamed President Obama. The Obama administration fired Flynn.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said this,  My only point is that when General Flynn came into the White House he had an active security clearance issued during the Obama administration with all of the information that s being discussed that occurred in 2015. So, I guess my only point is to explain how the process works and who adjudicated that. After Flynn was fired, Trump stood by him calling Flynn  a good man  and blaming the media for his departure from the administration. Flynn says he told Team Trump of his dealings with Turkey. It seems they knew about what Flynn was doing and just didn t understand how serious it was and what the implications for our national security are. It will be impossible to know without a subpoena.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images.",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Seth Meyers Torches Trump’s NAFTA Flip-Flop With Awesomely Dirty Joke (VIDEO),"Late Night host Seth Meyers regularly has a high old time making fun of the incompetence of Donald Trump and his administration during his  A Closer Look  monologues. On Thursday night, the subject was Trump s complete position change on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the campaign, Trump had repeatedly called NAFTA a  disaster,  but all it took was a couple of phone calls from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to get Trump to decide that the trade deal wasn t so bad after all.Meyers made fun of the whole thing by returning to his jokes prior to Trump s election, saying many of them are now reality, starting with: If we elect Trump we re going to end up fighting with Canada! Ha! Thanks to Trump s earlier threats to rip up NAFTA, Canada s  softwood lumber  exports became a hot topic. This was a golden opportunity for Meyers, who insisted there would be no jokes about male anatomy, but then he proceeded to make them anyway, saying: I m just saying that Donald Trump does not want to be slapped with soft-Canadian wood so he s clamping down on it. Meyers then went all in on the idea that Canada is deliberately axing prices of soft lumber   a process he referred to as  stumpage.  He continued: This is all very confusing for Trump because  stumpage  is his nickname for Donald Jr. As for the overall defeat of Trump s NAFTA termination promise? That was the best joke of all, when Meyers ended with a total zinger: Something tells me this isn t the first time Trump has had to pull out because of soft wood. HaHa, probably not. Then again, that s why he and all of those other old GOP men insist that health insurance always includes Viagra coverage.Watch the mockery below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Courts Decide Conspiracy Nut Alex Jones Is Too Crazy To Raise His Own Kids (DETAILS),"Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic. It now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass, since Jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children. After more than nine hours of considering the merits of Jones  case, a jury returned, giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children. Despite having joint custody, though, Jones  ex, Kelly Jones, will have most of the power.Prior to this battle, Alex Jones had the kids living with him, with their mother s rights being severely curtailed. She was only allowed supervised visits before. The reasons for this are unclear. She said tearfully to the press: I m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and I just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others. A lawyer for Kelly Jones, Robert Hoffman, said of Alex Jones: Mr. Jones is like a cult leader. And we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers. Indeed he is. Alex Jones whips his paranoid, ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery. He has promoted the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened, that 9/11 was actually carried out by the United States government, and all kinds of other craziness, and his rabid audience believes every word of it. Definitely, such a person should not be influencing children.  At any rate, it is good to see that jury made the right choice here, and hopefully Kelly Jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children.Featured image via screen capture from Infowars",News,"April 28, 2017"

" After Pepsi Botched Its Ad Campaign, Heineken Gets Theirs Exactly Right (VIDEO)","A few weeks ago, Pepsi decided to try to bridge the racial divide with what someone must have thought was a great idea. They ran an ad featuring Kendall Jenner, who, in the ad, tried to show police and African-Americans that their lives matter by letting a cop drink Pepsi.Here it is:The internet hated it (which might have been the point):Within 48 hours the video got nearly 1.6 million views on YouTube (five times as many downvotes as upvotes), and Twitter and Facebook lit up with people pointing out just how gauche the whole thing was. Activist DeRay Mckesson called it  trash,  adding  If I had carried Pepsi I guess I never would ve gotten arrested. Who knew?  People made memes (some even reaching back and evoking Pepper Spray Cop). And, rightfully, many folks pointed out that using protest imagery in order to peddle soda particularly images that evoked the photo of Ieshia Evans facing down police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana last year was pretty tasteless. It was one of the few times the internet ever agreed on anything.Source: WiredWhether in response to Pepsi s ad that never should have been, or whether this began organically, Heineken beer had their own version of an ad that addresses the political divide, but they got it right.In an experiment, they had complete strangers who would hate each other under normal circumstances, and put them in situations that created bonding.

" Paul Ryan BREAKS DOWN, Admits GOP’s Trumpcare Bill Is A Massive Failure (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has had it rough. Not only have they had to admit that their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, is an absolute nut job who can t do anything right, but their attempt to replace Obamacare has been just as much of a failure.The GOP has spent several years whining and moaning about how they would like to replace Obama s Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that a majority of Americans are in favor of keeping it. But once they finally had their chance to prove they could do better with Trump in the White House, they blew it.Recently at his weekly press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked if the House would vote on Trumpcare before Trump reached his first 100-day marker. Ryan s response was nothing short of absolute defeat and despair as he admitted that the GOP s horrible healthcare bill didn t have enough votes to pass. Ryan said: We want to go when we re ready to go. This has been a very organic bottom up process. It takes time to do that. We re doing big things, and you know me, I talked about 200 days because I thought the kind of agenda we re attempting to put together here overhauling health care, overhauling the tax system, rebuilding our military, securing the border. Those take more than just a few months. They take a long time, at least a year, so that s why we re working on the path to get it right, and not constrain it to some artificial deadline. What Ryan gave was a lot of excuses, along with his admission that he can t pass Trumpcare because there aren t enough votes to support a disastrous bill that would strip millions of Americans of their life-saving health insurance. It s entirely possible that the GOP will never have enough votes to make Trumpcare a thing, and Ryan s words are just as much empty promises as Trump s are.You can watch Ryan admit defeat below:Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Beyond Parody: Sean Spicer Blames Obama For Trump Hiring Foreign Agent Michael Flynn (VIDEO),"With questions mounting, Sean Spicer finally found an answer as to why Donald Trump hired known foreign agent and possible criminal Michael Flynn to be his National Security Advisor: It s Obama s fault.The Trump White House came up with their excuse seemingly overnight. Prior to Spicer s comments, the administration flailed for months. Meanwhile, Flynn s actions and Trump s cover up of them have swelled into a firestorm. Reporters have discovered that the now-fired Flynn was working for the Turkish government while on Trump s campaign, that Flynn told Trump s team that he was engaged in this illegal activity, and that the Pentagon had warned Flynn to cut it out as early as 2014.Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was warned by the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 against accepting foreign payments as he entered retirement, according to new documents obtained by the House oversight committee.A final nail in Flynn s coffin when it was learned that he was also accepting money from RT, the state-sponsored television station which largely operates as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. Flynn hid these payments, adding an additional level of wrongdoing.None of which stopped Trump from hiring Flynn as his top military advisor, defending him for weeks, then ultimately saying he didn t think Flynn had done anything wrong despite his resignation. Trump, who once boasted that he only hired the best people, has predictably decided to blame Obama rather than accept responsibility. A sad pattern that he leans on for many of his failings.Asked about Mike Flynn s vetting by the Trump team, Spicer blames the Obama admin. for renewing Flynn s security clearance years before pic.twitter.com/iPkuxA7uCu  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 27, 2017Spicer:General Flynn was a career military officer who maintained a high level security clearance throughout his career in the military. His clearance was last reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities.Spicer overlooks the fact that the military actually forced Flynn out in disgrace that same year for being  disruptive  and a warmonger who didn t listen to his superiors. He also overlooks that Trump, who by then knew of Flynn s history, decided to hire him as a full-time surrogate for his campaign, host him at the RNC (where Flynn led  lock her up  chants), then promoted him to National Security Advisor once elected.Trump is a natural born scam artist but this desperate stab at passing the buck will be a hard sell even to his most ardent supporters.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Fox News Host Jesse Watters Takes ‘Vacation’ After Disgusting Comments About Ivanka Trump,"Remember when Bill O Reilly took a vacation after his sexual harassment payoffs went public? Well, let s hope Jesse Watters  vacation is permanent, too.Watters is a product of Bill O Reilly s former Fox News program. The racist and sexist segments known as Watters  World often targeted specific groups in a sick and twisted version of right-wing  humor. From there, Watters was promoted as a guest host and just days after beginning a full-time gig on The Five, he is already taking time off after making a crude oral sex joke about Ivanka Trump on the air.While discussing Trump being jeered and booed in Germany for hypocritically talking about empowerment of women, Watters complained about liberals attacking Ivanka and characterized those attacks as anti-women even though what liberals are criticizing for is her blatant hypocrisy. Ivanka claims to be a champion for women s rights but stands idly by while her father signs executive orders reducing protections for women. In short, she is complicit by staying silent.Anyway, Watters couldn t control himself and ended up making a sex joke about Ivanka only days after Bill O Reilly was fired for sexual harassment. And his joke came just after whining about how liberals are supposedly  disrespecting  women by booing Ivanka. I really like the way she is speaking into that microphone,  Watters said while gesturing with his hands, implying that he s talking about oral sex.Here s the video via YouTube.Watters later tried to cover his ass by claiming that he was merely talking about her voice. On air I was referring to Ivanka s voice and how it resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ,  Watters wrote.  This was in no way a joke about anything else. Viewers of Watters  words and actions drew sharp criticism, especially from conservative writer John Podheretz, who referred to Watters as a  disgusting creep. You are so full of shit it s coming out your ears, you disgusting creep. https://t.co/1cnrfc8rDC  John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) April 26, 2017And now Watters is going on a  vacation  for the rest of the week.Again, Watters was only on his third day on the job as a full-time host of The Five and he couldn t control himself from making a crude sex joke about a woman. He demonstrated perfectly that the sexist environment at Fox News has not changed at all. It s merely been taken over by younger frat boys.If Fox News is serious about changing the culture at their network, they should make sure Watters stays on  vacation.

 Trump Administration Admits That Latest Executive Order Was Nothing But An Empty Photo Op (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is quickly closing in on his first 100 days in office, and despite his many, many promises of accomplishments during this presidential milestone, he s accomplished zilch other than a handful of executive orders that would help make America and the world a living stinkhole. So what does Trump, whose ever and only a showman do? He holds photo ops, where he holds up oversized documents to show off his cartoonish signature.His latest executive order was the type of empty photo op you d expect from a game show host, not from a president, because it literally did nothing. It was supposed to empower education secretary, Betsy DeVos to screw with Washington, D.C. public schools in much the same way as Trump is allowing oil companies to screw with our environment. Why just D.C.? Because they are the only school district within the purview of the federal government and not the states. So, every time Republicans want to bully people of color, they go after Washington, D.C. Fortunately for the school children, though, this executive order was about as toothless as the average Fox News viewer, as Senior Department of Education official Rob Goad admitted:Q You said at the top that this executive order would empower the Secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that don t comply with law. How will that process work?MR. GOAD: So I think at the end of 300 days, and after we have produced a report, we will make those decisions once the report has concluded.Q So is she empowered to modify the regulations as needed, or is that going to be a separate process entirely?MR. GOAD: The executive order gives her   empowers her to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal law.Q Isn t she already empowered to do those things? This executive order doesn t give her those powers, right?MR. GOAD: That s right.Source: ShareBlueThat, apparently, was too much transparency for the administration. Goad was prompted to shut down the press conference right after that question.",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Americans TORCH Hypocrite GOP Lawmaker For Using Affordable Care Act To Get Major Surgery Before Leaving Office,"Donald Trump and the Republican Congress are busy trying to shred healthcare for the rest of us, but one Republican lawmaker is using Obamacare to get major surgery before he leaves office.Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz has been outspoken about the Republican effort to kill the Affordable Care Act. He s been salivating at doing so for years. He calls it a failed program that has done nothing but hurt the American people.But while he s busy trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law, he has no problem using it himself.Earlier this month, Chaffetz announced that he would not seek re-election after his current term expires. However, he s going to make sure he sucks as much healthcare out of American taxpayers as he can before he officially leaves.Chaffetz posted a message to Facebook on Wednesday night informing his constituents that he will be getting major surgery on his foot and will be taking the next 3-4 weeks offChaffetz seriously expects us to understand and give a damn about his situation. The problem is that he lacks sympathy and empathy when it comes to ordinary Americans who can t afford such surgeries and the amount of recovery time required.And if Republicans succeed at killing the Affordable Care Act, Americans will be at serious risk of not having health insurance to cover such medical procedures.Chaffetz, on the other hand, is using his gold level health insurance under the Affordable Care Act to cover his surgery. So he is literally using the Affordable Care Act to make sure his healthcare needs are met, and after he has no further use for it he ll vote to kill the law for everyone else.Americans were not happy about this hypocrisy, so they stormed Chaffetz s Twitter page and hammered him for it.@jasoninthehouse And you re going to use this as a teachable moment as to why coverage for pre-existing conditions and paid health leave is important, yes?

" White House Staffer Admits, “This S***’s Hard” As The Trump Administration Faces Steep Learning Curve","It is no secret that President Donald Trump et al had no idea what they were getting into when they took over the White House in January. Despite announcing,  In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly,  (he made this comment last November) Team Trump seems barely able to find their way to work every day. As the 100 day mark looms, it seems White House staffers are starting to get the enormity of the job.Politico interviewed numerous people within the administration to get their take on how things are going within the administration. Perhaps one aide put it best when he said this,  I kind of pooh-poohed the experience stuff when I first got here but this shit is hard. For his part, Trump does not seem to understand the scope of some of his failures, such as with health care reform or his inability to have any major legislation passed but it looks like the people around him are starting to get it. They are in a tough spot. They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability but are hampered by a president who refuses to give up any of his free time and puts more stock in opinions he sees on cable news than what he gets in his security briefings.This has forced Trump s aides to change their tactics. One high level official told Politico, You don t walk in with a traditional presentation, like a binder or a PowerPoint. He doesn t care. He doesn t consume information that way. You go in and tell him the pros and cons, and what the media coverage is going to be like. One big hurdle White House staffers face is how to control Trump. One person who is close to the administration said,  It s not like the White House doesn t have a plan to fill his time productively but at the end of the day he s in charge of his schedule. He does not like being managed. Despite the possibility that the White House staffers are more aware of the challenges they face, some upsetting facts remain. Many high level positions remain unfilled. Neither Secretary of State Rex Tillerson nor Secretary of Defense James Mattis have deputies. Most ambassadorships are empty. The problem is not just that Team Trump doesn t know how to deal with Congress, it s that they simply do not know how to govern.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2017"

 Dem Lawmaker Out-Trolls Internet Troll By Calling His Grandmother (IMAGE),"The Internet can be a vicious place and an openly gay lawmaker has gotten used to being the recipient of homophobic slurs. On Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania House Rep. Brian Sims woke up to find a message on his Facebook page which read,  N**ger faggot.  There wasn t much information on the troll s Facebook page. What caught me about it was there wasn t a reference to something I said or something I d done or some policy,  Sims told the Huffington Post.  And when I looked at his page there was very little there   but he d posted a telephone number a number of times. At 6:15 a.m. Sims decided to call the number and the woman who answered the phone turned out to be the troll s grandmother. You ve all seen the  Brave keyboard warrior sitting in Mom s basement eating a hot pocket sandwich  type meme but this was real life. I explained to her exactly who I as and what he had done,  Sims said.  Like any grandma she was very embarrassed at having this kind of convo and very ashamed at the actions of her grandson. The conversation ended with me telling her that I wanted to hear from him. Sims did speak to the troll but he said that the conversation  didn t resolve anything. It is the ultimate calling card of a coward to   under the guise of night and behind a keyboard   use the kind of language that in person would cause most decent people to respond in anger and frustration,  Sims said.  The reason people do things like this is they don t have the courage, the education or gumption to do this kind of thing in person.

 Trump Set Up An Alien Crime Hotline And It Went Exactly Like You’re Thinking Right Now (TWEETS),"Recently, Donald Trump became the second major elected leader in history to publish a newsletter focusing on crimes committed by a segment of the population he wanted to demonize   Adolf Hitler with  The Criminal Jew  (a regularly published list of crimes allegedly committed by Jews) and Donald Trump with his Weekly and Declined Detainer Outcome Report, a regular publication of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants. The word  allegedly is important here, because Trump s list so far has been mostly Latinos who are accused but have not been convicted of anything at all.Trump decided that a newsletter attacking all immigrants because some allegedly have committed crimes (at a much lower rate than the rest of us), so he established VOICE   an entire department committed to criminalizing the Jews immigrants. While Trump set up a hotline for VOICE in an effort to give people an outlet for engaging this bigoted right-wing fantasy that immigrants are all criminals, he was in for a shock when people started calling. They called 1-855-48-VOICE about aliens, all right   just not the ones he wanted them to call about.Trumps   VOICE  Hotline set up for people to report on crime from illegal aliens was reportedly overloaded with calls about space aliens  Robbie Gramer (@RobbieGramer) April 26, 2017Trump wants you to report ""bad aliens"", so join me in complaining about the Hutt criminal organization in the Outer Rim: 1-855-48-VOICE.

If you have seen any strange alien activity   especially criminal   you should call. Whether you or a friend were abducted or probed, have seen crop circle-based vandalism, or witnessed livestock being turned inside out, it is your duty as a patriotic American to speak out.The number once again is 1-855-48-VOICE.

 Trump Considers ‘Terminating NAFTA’ With Executive Order (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) unless they are willing to renegotiate with him for a better deal.This is what Trump had to say about NAFTA during his recent word salad of an interview with the Associated Press earlier this week.AP: What about NAFTA? What s the plan on NAFTA?TRUMP: What would you like to know?AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.AP: Termination is still on the table.TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.AP: What s a timeline for that decision?TRUMP: It s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it s a six-month clause.CNN reported today that two senior administration officials had confirmed that Trump is debating withdrawing the U.S. from NAFTA through an executive order. The White House is currently mulling an executive order declaring the US  intent to withdraw from NAFTA, a move that could trigger a renegotiation of the trade pact rather than outright withdrawal,  the officials told CNN.This isn t a new stance for Trump, who railed against NAFTA throughout his campaign. In June, Trump declared that NAFTA was  the worst trade deal in  the history of this country. I m going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot, not just a little, by a lot for our workers. And if they don t agree to a renegotiation, which they might not, because they re so used to having their own way not with Trump, they won t have their own way then I will submit under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal,  Trump declared to his rabid supporters last summer.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
" After Being Handed Yet Another Court Loss, Trump Threatens Revenge In Pure Dictator Style","Donald Trump hates losing. Not because it s a loss to his agenda, or a perceived loss to the American people. Trump hates losing because it hurt his paper thin ego and when he does lose, there s hell to pay (or at least threatened hell to pay). Trump suffered another major loss in court after a 9th Circuit Court judge ruled against his attempt at defundng sanctuary cities. Now, like a true dictator, Trump wants to break up the 9th Circuit.In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump said about breaking up the court: Absolutely, I have,  Trump said of considering 9th Circuit breakup proposals during a far-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner at the White House.  There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It s outrageous. He then accused liberal plaintiffs of court shopping for a more sympathetic body. Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that s like, semi-automatic,  Trump said.The 9th Circuit, which covers nine western states and Guam, is based in San Francisco. San Francisco is, of course, one of the sanctuary cities, so plaintiffs didn t have go far to land on their docket.While the 9th has had some liberal rulings:Covering a huge swath of territory   nine western states plus Guam   the San Francisco-based court handles far more cases than any other federal appeals court, including some rulings that have invoked furor from conservatives over the years. Among them: finding that the phrase  under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, that the  don t ask, don t tell  policy on gays in the military was problematic long before President Barack Obama s administration ended it, and that states can force pharmacies to dispense emergency contraceptives.Source: Mercury NewsThey are far more balanced than right-wingers would let on.But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit s liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter s appointees   who were considered extremely liberal   have taken semi-retired  senior  status or passed away. A Democratic Congress nearly doubled the number of judges on the court during Carter s tenure, and his appointees faced easy confirmation in the Senate.President George W. Bush appointed six of the court s 25 active judges, but 18 have been appointed by Democrats, though the seven appointed by President Barack Obama are generally considered moderate, said University of Richmond Law School Professor Carl Tobias.Still, conservatives, and especially Trump, would like nothing more than to make California even less relevant in national politics (a vote in California is worth less than 1/3 of a vote in Wyoming).The bigger picture behind Trump s threat is far more disturbing. We have three (supposedly) co-equal branches of government. Trump is trying to use his executive powers to shut down any dissenting views, even from another branch. Even if you are a Trump voter, you should find this very disconcerting.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Republican GOES OFF On Trump’s Border Wall In STUNNING No-Holds-Barred Rant (VIDEO),"Out of all the ridiculous, misguided ideas that have come up during his first 100 days, Donald Trump s border wall is definitely one of the least popular ones. Trump s border wall has not only been rejected by the majority of the American people, but politicians   even Republicans   are still strongly resisting the wall.Earlier today, Will Hurd (R-TX) went on Fox Business News to blast Trump and his beloved wall, unleashing a surprising and shocking rant that perfectly sums up why this border wall should not be created under any circumstances. Clearly stating that Trump s border wall is extremely ineffective and will cost way too much money, Rep. Hurd said: I ve been pretty clear on this idea of a wall, building a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security.I spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer in the CIA chasing terrorists all over the world, nuclear weapons proliferators. And I have 820 miles of the border, more border than any other member of Congress. We need to be using additional technology and more manpower on the border you can t have a one size fits all solution for the border. Trump s border wall had come under fire recently as the incompetent POTUS tried to bully lawmakers into funding his wall before the government was forced to shut down. Trump s wall is going to be a disaster for U.S. taxpayers, considering that Trump refuses to accept the fact that Mexico isn t going to pay for the wall, or reimburse the United States like Trump says they will.Thankfully, there are at least some Republicans who understand what a disaster this border wall is. You can watch Hurd rip Trump and his wall apart below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 WATCH: Sean Spicer’s Debut in “The Bold and the Babbling” Is Everything You Expect And More,"President Donald Trump has made one thing clear, he cares about ratings more than anything else in the world. This week the Washington Post reported that when asked if he was planning firing Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary Trump said,  I m not firing Sean Spicer. That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The President went on to compare the daily White House briefing to a soap opera and noted that Spicer gets better ratings than the soaps that are on today. Trump s love of television is so well known that aides use it as a way to reach him and foreign leaders are even starting to do the same. They are finding ways to show up on the shows they think the president is most likely to watch.Stephen Colbert took advantage of the comments connecting Spicer to soap operas to create one of his own.

" WATCH: Joe Scarborough Gets MOCKED For Comparing Ivanka To RFK, He Doesn’t Respond Well AT ALL","Joe Scarborough is not having the best morning. On Morning Joe earlier today, the conversation turned to the number of Trump family members who are serving in the White House and the rampant nepotism there. This led Scarborough to compare President Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka, to a Robert F. Kennedy.Scarborough said that having Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, working for him in the West Wing created the same kind of situation that upset so many Republicans during the Kennedy administration. When Host Mika Brzezinski questioned that logic, Scarborough did not take it well.Scarborough s rant went like this,  You don t have to be so snotty. I was about to say, you didn t let me get it out. You don t have to be so rude. The fact of the matter is that they are not Bobby Kennedy as I was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in. No I am not saying Jared and Ivanka are Bobby Kennedy. Maybe it s time for the host to switch to decaf.Here s the video:Featured image via Carolyn Cole/Getty Images.",News,"April 26, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican House Oversight Chair Literally Blamed Obama For Trump’s Michael Flynn Scandal,"Republicans have apparently reached a new level of desperation to clear Donald Trump of all wrongdoing in his Russia scandal.Donald Trump chose Michael Flynn to work on his campaign. Donald Trump chose Michael Flynn to be his National Security Adviser. Donald Trump ignored the warnings about Michael Flynn. But somehow, Republicans are blaming President Obama anyway.As we all know, Flynn had dealings with Russia that he failed to disclose, including conversations with Russian officials about the sanctions placed by President Obama in retaliation against Russia for interfering in our national election.Flynn s ties to Russia run deep and one would think that Trump would have vetted Flynn. After all, Trump had plenty of time to do so during the campaign and after taking office.But he appointed Flynn anyway and even voiced his support of his National Security Adviser until the very end when Trump was forced to boot him out the White House.President Harry Truman once said that  The buck stops here  in reference to the fact that anything that happens during a president s tenure is the ultimate responsibility of the president.But Trump has done everything he can in an effort to escape any and all responsibility for what happens under his watch or lack thereof.And even Republicans have been making excuses to absolve him of any wrongdoing.That includes openly blaming President Obama for Trump s Flynn scandal.During an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday, House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Cheffetz literally claimed that President Obama is at fault for this scandal. It was the Obama White House that this would have fallen under,  Chaffetz told Greta Van Susteran.  I don t think what happened here is really the fault of Donald Trump. Here s the video via VidMe.According to Cheffetz, the Obama administration is at fault because they vetted Flynn before he was appointed by Obama to head the Defense Intelligence Agency.However, prior to getting caught dealing with Russia earlier this year, Flynn had kept his ties to Russia under the radar. Those ties became much clearer after he got busted. Besides, Trump is the one responsible for hiring Flynn during the campaign and he is the one responsible for appointing him as National Security Adviser. Trump and his administration had lots of time to vet Flynn.So this falls directly and completely on Donald Trump. He had months to dig into Flynn s history, and clearly, he liked what he found. After all, they share a love of Putin and Russia in common.Cheffetz should just go ahead and resign immediately rather than serve out the remainder of his term. One would think that Cheffetz would feel free to do the right thing since he has chosen not to run for re-election. But it s apparent that he intends to lie and cover for Trump until the end. He should be ashamed.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 26, 2017"
 PAY-TO-PLAY: Ivanka Uses Official Europe Trip To Beg For Donations,"If Hillary Clinton were in the White House and she hired her daughter, Chelsea, to work in the West Wing and then let her fundraise for the Clinton Foundation, the GOP House would be drawing up Articles of Impeachment. That is exactly what is happening in President Donald Trump s White House. First daughter, Ivanka, is currently in Germany representing him. She works in the West Wing and is one of the main people the President listens to.Many have been wondering what Ivanka has been up to in her job at the White House. Now at least some of her time can be accounted for. She has set up a fund to help female entrepreneurs and has been soliciting funds from foreign countries. Axios is reporting that several have already donated. They include several Middle East countries.Axios is also reporting that her father is a big supporter of the idea. This is curious, given the President s problems with the Clinton Foundation, which also did a lot of good work and asked for money from foreigners and foreign governments. Trump and others brought up the idea that donations were made in order to gain access to the then Secretary of State. During the campaign, he went as far as to call the Clinton Foundation a  criminal enterprise. Trump told FOX News  Chris Wallace,  Saudi Arabia given $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women s rights? These are people that push gays off business, off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money. So I d like to ask you right now why don t you give back the money that you ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? It is hard to see any difference between what Trump accused Hillary of doing and what his daughter is doing now. It s going to be interesting seeing how White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tries to explain this one.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"

My thing is, I feel bad because her whole life, she was troubled, could never find what made her happy and content,  Baio said on a radio show.  For me, you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die. Baio had zero evidence of the circumstances behind Moran s death, so he should have kept quiet until the official cause was released. As it turns out, Moran died after a battle with cancer.Baio s baseless speculation angered her grieving fans, but especially pissed off her family members, who took to social media to roast Baio alive. Moran s brother Tony struck first.#scottbaio. Get on your knees and pray I never run into you.  tony moran (@tmoran_mmyers78) April 25, 2017After discovering his error, Baio took to Facebook and blamed the media and claimed he was criticized because he s a Trump supporter. I m sure they re attacking me because I m a conservative,  Baio remarked.  These people never attack the press for getting the story wrong about heroin. They attack me. Well, Tony Moran wasn t impressed. In fact, he called Baio out for being a coward after Baio had his wife call him to apologize instead of doing it himself.#scottbaio. Your wife contacts me? Not u?

He also slammed Baio on Facebook.A special shout out to Scott Baio. I already went on Twitter about you. I hope it finds you. You and my lil sis had a very very brief fling. She dumped you. 2 reasons. 1. She told me that you were more like a lil girl and not a man. 2. She told me that you were tiny. Ya know. Barely a man in the man region. True story! Scott, I d advise you to get on your knees and pray you never run into me.Well guys. Guess what? I was contacted by Scott Baio s wife. His wife! Fucking coward! I ve never met her. I do know the scumbag piece of shit Scott Baio tho. He was a piece of shit back then and still is. He had his wife contact me! Very apologetic and shit. Doesn t surprise me. It s too late you motherfucking pieces of shit! Go back under the rock you crawled out from under. There isn t one word I want to hear you speak. Makes me sick to my stomach.Scott Baio openly admitted in his Facebook post that he speculated on Erin Moran s cause of death only to find out that she had stage 4 cancer later on. He should have just personally apologized for his own words and actions rather than blaming the media. He knew damn well that an official cause of death had not been released yet. And he certainly should have spoken to Moran s brother personally instead of having his wife do it. Instead of handling Moran s death like a human being, Baio acted like a cowardly douchebag and he s getting the criticism he deserves. And he has only himself to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 26, 2017"
" Caitlyn Jenner Slams Trump, Considers Running for Office","Caitlyn Jenner is not afraid to speak her mind. The Olympian turned reality TV star is making news once again. This week, while promoting her new book,  The Secrets of My Life,  she admitted that while she is a Republican and voted for President Donald Trump she is not happy with all of the president s policies and actions.Jenner spoke to a packed audience at the 92nd Street Y Community Center in New York this week. She says that she is looking into where her voice can be heard the loudest and how she can do the most to impact her community. She says that she does not regret voting for the president but she is not thrilled with everything has done. In the past she has said that she is a Republican because she supports  the Constitution and limited government. While she says that she has no regrets about voting for the president, Jenner admits,  As far as LGBT issues, yes, he s made some mistakes. I don t support him in everything that he does. But we needed to shake the system up. At the same time, Jenner said,  My loyalties are not with Donald Trump. I will come after him and come after Republicans if they come after my community. I ve got a voice and they better listen, OK? I will come after them. When a member of the audience asked if she had any plans to run for elected office, Jenner replied,  Would I be better working from the inside? If that is the case   I would seriously look at a run. It just depends where I could be more effective. Some people know Jenner from her time as Bruce when she won multiple gold medals in the Olympics during the 1970s. Younger generations know her from the show  Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Viewers watched her before her transformation, through the process and then after. The family has not responded well to her new book.Before she told the world that she was transgender, Jenner thought she had  too many skeletons  in her closet. Now that the world knows about that, she says,  Now, I have no more secrets.  I would have to look over the next year or two and see,  Can I do a better job on the outside?  or  Am I in a position now that I can do a better job for my community on the inside?

 The UN Just Sent Trump A DIRE Warning About Obamacare,"It would seem that the Democrats  talking point, that healthcare is a human right, isn t just a talking point. The United Nations has taken notice of Republicans  efforts to repeal Obamacare without a solid replacement that will guarantee nobody loses their coverage. The GOP s plans all involve stipulations that could strip coverage from millions, which could violate international laws to which the U.S. is bound.The U.N. s High Commissioner on Human Rights sent a letter to the Trump administration, and asked that it be shared with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. Of course, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, didn t receive it, at least, not through the usual channels. Oddly enough, neither did Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell.Apparently, the State Department never saw it either, but an employee at HHS leaked it to Democratic leadership.The letter cites Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which says: [Countries have] the core obligation to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups. It also cites Article 5(e) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which says: [Countries should] guarantee the right of everyone,  including  the rights to public health, medical care, social security and social services  without regard to race or color. It s important to note that while we both signed and ratified the latter agreement here.If Obamacare is repealed without a replacement that protects coverage for everyone, the people who stand to lose their insurance, and thus, their access to healthcare, are the poor and the working class. Racial minorities are more likely to be poor, or a member of the struggling working class. Rural areas with depressed economies (the places that all voted for Trump) would suffer, too.Since the Trump administration didn t send the letter on as requested, it stands to reason that they don t want Congress to see this (or really, anyone). Too bad it got out. At best, this is another PR and political disaster that Trump doesn t need. At worst, we re in some serious trouble if they don t give up their plans to strip millions of their health insurance.Featured image by Olivier Douliery-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Republicans Just Granted Themselves Special Status In Their Latest Healthcare Bill,"If you have a pre-existing condition, Obamacare currently protects you from being turned down for insurance on the basis of that condition. Republicans want to take that away because insuring sick people just eats too much profit, and healthcare is a privilege, not a right anyway. The latest iteration of their ridiculous healthcare plan will allow states to decide whether insurers have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, because of course it does, but it also contains a brand-new amendment that s patently disgusting.It carves an exemption out for members of Congress and their staffs. Insurers would still be required to provide coverage for them regardless of pre-existing conditions. Vox confirmed it last night: A spokesperson for Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) who authored this amendment confirmed this was the case: members of Congress and their staff would get the guarantee of keeping these Obamacare regulations. But don t Republicans hate Obamacare? Well, their relationship with Obamacare is actually considerably more complex than we tend to give it credit for. Contrary to popular belief, we taxpayers don t subsidize Congress  health insurance the way many people think. In fact, we never did. Until 2013, they were covered under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, which is a health insurance marketplace where they (and every other federal employee) purchase health insurance with all the same bullshit as everyone else, and have their premiums taken out of their paychecks.The Office of Personnel Management contributes to each employee s premium, but where private sector employers cover an average of 83 percent of their employees  premiums (or 72 percent for family plans), OPM covers 72 to 75 percent, whichever is less depending on a variety of factors, across the board.In 2013, all of Congress was kicked off of FEHB thanks to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). He proposed an amendment to the ACA that would require all members of Congress to purchase health insurance through the exchanges, and for their staffs under the small business provision.So that s what they ve been doing for health insurance for the last four years. Where their own lives are concerned, Obamacare s popular provisions are good things. Where the rest of the country is concerned, though, well, we all know how they feel about the rest of us. The prohibition on denying insurance due to pre-existing conditions is one of the most popular provisions and they want to gut it.For everyone but themselves.Can they get any more obvious about where their true priorities lie?Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Court Slams Down Trump’s Order Blocking Funding To Sanctuary Cities,"During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump made a lot of promises on immigration. He was going to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, that Mexico would fund. He was going to keep Muslims from coming into the country. Lastly, he was going to cut funding to  sanctuary cities.  Now it looks like none of that is going to happen. The travel bans have been struck down. The border wall is never going to happen. Now, a federal court has ruled against taking funding away from sanctuary cities.Sanctuary cities are those that refuse to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport undocumented immigrants who report crimes. It s important to note that lacking documentation is a civil offense, not a criminal one. This is the second of Trump s main policy initiatives to be struck down because it violates the U.S. Constitution.Both San Francisco and Santa Clara County won orders squashing an executive order, signed by Trump on January 25, 2017 to halt funding to any cities who refuse to deport undocumented immigrants for minor offenses. The president has said these cities can cause,  immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our republic.  U.S. District Judge William Orrick did not see it that way. He sided with San Francisco and Santa Clara County.While Trump wants to appear powerful, it is clear that he is not aware of what limits there are on presidential power. The president does not decide how federal funds are spent. That s Congress s job. The budget that is submitted by the White House every year is simply a wish list of what the president would like to see federal money spent on. Congress is under no obligation to follow the budget. By the same token, once funds have been allocated for a program, a president cannot just block that funding because it suits his or her objectives.The White House promises to appeal the decision and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that the courts in California are  going bananas.  He added,  The idea that an agency can t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually, and we ll win at the Supreme Court level at some point. For its part, the Department of Justice assets that federal agencies are still allowed to act against any cities or towns that violate or ignore federal immigration laws. Department spokesman Ian Prior said,  The court upheld the government s ability to use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants,  Ian Prior said in an emailed statement. The ruling is not just a victory for these two jurisdictions. Its impact will be felt in sanctuary cities and jurisdictions across the nation. Cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. This ruling is also giving energy to Californians who want to be seen as leading the resistance against the Trump administration. The Californian state Senate put through the  California Values Act.  This would turn the entire state into a sanctuary zone.",News,"April 26, 2017"
" Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true route of blaming President Obama.Spicer explained that the Trump White House isn t responsible for anything related to Flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the Obama administration  and  those are not documents that the White House would ever possess. Everything that the White House has been asked to do, the only documents that were made available to [Congress] that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had,  Spicer said, explaining that he doesn t feel that the White House has an obligation to provide the information Congress has requested. How about these calls made where [Flynn] was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump?  CBS s Major Garrett asked.  Aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can? It s a question [of] if you can,  Spicer said.  To ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish. Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition were they not?  Garrett asked. Spicer, of course, told him that Trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before January 20 even if it was done by a member of the Trump transition team. When?  Spicer asked.  We started this administration on Jan. 20. All the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House. Working for the transition!  Garrett pressed. Not at the White House!  Spicer snapped.  Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to Jan. 20th. Trump and his White House are absolutely responsible for Flynn   which is not good, as even Hillary Clinton witch hunter, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, admits that Flynn likely committed crimes.Watch this all happen below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2017"
" Trump Just Sent A MAJOR F*ck You To The Supreme Court, CONFIRMS His Own Incompetency (DETAILS)","Donald Trump and his administration have proven time and time again that they are incapable of performing even the most simple, basic tasks that only require basic human decency and manners. The latest gaffe in the White House demonstrates that even as Trump s 100th day approaches, they still can t get their sh*t together.According to a White House aide and court spokeswoman, Trump did not extend a formal invitation to the Supreme Court to have dinner at the White House on Thursday. An initial report that was released early Sunday stated that a dinner WOULD take place: That evening, the President will have dinner with the Justices of the Supreme Court, including his successfully confirmed nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch. However, this changed just hours later. On Sunday night, the dinner with the Supreme Court justices was taken off the agenda. The White House aide confirmed: An invitation was never extended. When White House press secretary Sean Spicer was questioned about the nixed dinner plans, Spicer said Trump s staffers  moved some things around  and perhaps the dinner might happen at a later time. Spicer said: I think having a relationship and meeting with the Supreme Court at some point would be a great idea and something that we hope to have on the schedule at some point soon. Trump s rude, disorganized cancellation is hardly the only issue with these tentative dinner plans. While former presidents have had dinner with Supreme Court justices before, Trump s corrupt administration definitely raised some eyebrows when they first announced these dinner plans. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said it best: Why would the Supreme Court agree to do this? I can think of no legitimate reason to dine with a litigant. No matter what Trump does, he can t help but raise ethical concerns as his scandals and conflict of interests only mount up. Trump s administration is not only the most incompetent, lazy, and disorganized, but it is the most corrupt and must be watched closely.Featured image via Tom Pennington / Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 New Poll Has Very Bad News For The NRA (DETAILS),"While it may not come as much of a surprise that the leadership at the National Rifle Association (NRA) has a different opinion on gun control than the average American, what is surprising is that same leadership holds a different opinion than the American gun owner. According to a new poll, at least 67 percent of gun owners in the United States believe that the organization has changed its mission from one promoting gun safety to one dominated by professional lobbyists. They say the NRA has been  overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission. The NRA of today looks very different from what it looked like before. In fact, for most of its history, it supported, and even wrote, gun control legislation. Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, wrote,  Historically, the leadership of the NRA was more open-minded about gun control than someone familiar with the modern NRA might imagine. To understand the relationship the NRA has with gun control. It may help to look at who and why it was founded. After the Civil War, many people in the North believed that people in the South possessed superior skills in the area of using rifles. They blamed that for the length of the war. The national slogan for the NRA was,  Firearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.  Its main goal was to improve men s marksmanship, not ward off threats to the Second Amendment. The organization was founded in 1871.That effort didn t start until the 1970s. In 1934, the nation saw its first piece of gun control legislation signed into law. The National Firearms Act of 1934 was designed to  make it difficult for any not law abiding citizen to obtain a pistol or revolver.  It was authored, in part, by the NRA. They also helped write the Gun Control Act of 1938.When these bills were written and signed into law, Karl T. Frederick was president of the NRA. He said,  I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses. For about a century, the NRA s motto remained the same. Then the 1960s happened. With the unrest of the assassinations and the rise of the Black Panthers, The Mulford Act was passed in California. It barred people from carrying loaded weapons around outside. While it was supported by the NRA, the backlash that it spurred also galvanized a new wave of gun support. About a decade after the act was signed into law, a group of gun rights supporters took over the NRA. They ousted the leadership and changed the motto to,  The Right Of The People To Keep And Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed. Since then, the NRA has opposed many measures that have had widespread support from the American public. In poll after poll, people say they want people who buy guns to pass background checks, they want to limit the capacity of rifles and they support common sense gun control legislation. Even Supreme Court Justice Anontin Scalia supported limiting some of this. In his Heller v. DC decision, Scalia wrote,  Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. New data show more support for gun control from gun owners. While the NRA leadership says one thing, the average gun owner thinks another. A few years ago, Wayne LaPierre, NRA chief, said,  The only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.  This is the response from gun owners to that new poll.For its part, the NRA is disputing the accuracy of the poll. Jennifer Baker, spokesperson for the NRA said,  The NRA s strength is derived from our five million members and the tens of millions of Second Amendment supporters who vote. The majority of Americans oppose gun control and they made their voices heard this past November. This was a poll paid for by a gun control group, so it s not surprising that the so called  results  further their agenda. Public Policy Polling conducted the poll between April 19 and 20. It included 661 people who own guns. The margin of error is four percentage points. Americans for Responsible Solutions commissioned the poll.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 BREAKING: Mexico Stands Strong AGAINST Trump’s Wall; Delivers BRUTAL Remarks,"It s not just Canada that Donald Trump seems to be starting unnecessary battles with today, Mexico has responded to his continued persistence of the border wall.In fact, Mexico is now considering Trump s insistence of the wall, and the lie that Mexico will pay for it, a  hostile  act.According to Reuters Politics: JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a  hostile  act, will not contribute in any way JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a 'hostile' act, will not contribute in any way  Reuters Politics (@ReutersPolitics) April 25, 2017This comes shortly after Trump recommitted his efforts to build the wall.According to the New York Times: President Trump insisted on Tuesday that he remained committed to his hotly disputed plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, despite backing off a demand that the project be funded in a short-term spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.

 Trump SLAMS Canada By Using Example Border State; That State Doesn’t Border Canada (TWEET),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t have a clue what he is doing. He hears things in clips and talking points, and then spews them out to the world, usually via Twitter, without thinking about the weight of his actions.One of the things Trump has been hung up on lately is Canada taking control of their dairy. According to Business Insider: Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with the US-produced imports. How dare they, right? The United States should not only legislate in their own country regarding the market but also around the world. At least that s what Trump seems to think.So Trump, trying to puff his chest and seem like he s a tough guy, tweets out: Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch! Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!  Donald J.

 Cummings And Chaffetz Reveal ‘MAJOR PROBLEM’ For Trump: Appears Flynn Committed A Felony (VIDEO),"Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) dropped a bombshell on Tuesday morning. During a press conference, they announced what Cummings described as a  major problem  for the Trump administration: it looks like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn committed a felony. We received a response from the White House refusing to provide any of the documents we requested,  Cummings said.  The White House has refused to offer a single piece of paper in response to this committee s bipartisan request. According to the congressman, classified military documents have revealed that Flynn failed to disclose payments he received from foreign governments before he became Trump s National security advisor. This is a major problem,  Cummings said. I believe these documents should be declassified to the fullest extent possible without compromising sources or methods,  he added.Cumings also noted that Flynn s illegal actions could land him in prison for up to five years. Chaffetz said that if these documents are correct, then Flynn s actions were clearly illegal   and there will be consequences. As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,  Chaffetz said.  And it appears as if he did take that money, it was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for it as a violation of the law. The congressmen, who both serve as senior members of the House Oversight Committee, said that so far, they haven t seen a shred of evidence to suggest that Flynn actually followed the law and got permission from the federal government before taking cash from multiple foreign governments.You can watch video of their press conference, here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper HUMILIATES Trump With The Sad Truth About His Pathetic First 100 Days,"Donald Trump recently said that grading his first 100 days is a ridiculous standard, but as Jake Tapper points out, Trump set the standard himself during the campaign.When Mitt Romney ran for president in 2012, he quickly made a name for himself as a serial flip-flopper. Well, Donald Trump is flip-flopping even more.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made a lot of promises about what he would get done during his first 100 days, even going so far as to present a 100 days action plan listing what Americans could expect him to accomplish during that period.But now that his first 100 days winding down, Trump realized that he is a total failure and quickly posted a tweet designed to make it sound like the first 100 days standard is no big deal.No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017Trump has even released a list of his so-called  historic accomplishments  to make it appear like he has done great things since taking over the White House.Jake Tapper was not impressed and it only took him four minutes to take Trump down on Monday night.The CNN host began informing Trump of his record low approval ratings and pointed out that not a single major piece of legislation has been signed despite Republicans controlling Congress. With historically low approval ratings and zero pieces of major legislation signed into law, President Trump has had an empirically disappointing first 100 days. Perhaps that s the reason he recently tweeted about the  ridiculous  standard of the first 100 days. Indeed, Trump often brags about himself and whines about the media when they tell the truth about him.Tapper then demonstrated Trump s hypocrisy by showing clips of him repeatedly bragging about how much he would get done in the first 100 days. In other words, Trump held himself to the standard that he now claims is  ridiculous. He changed his tune on this marker this very conceit that he promoted with his 100-day action plan,  Tapper continued.  Which is not really a surprise, because President Trump often heralds his flexibility. Tapper went on to hit Trump for flip-flopping on all of his positions during the campaign, like when he said that  NATO is obsolete,  only to turn around and admit that NATO is not obsolete after coming face to face with NATO officials. Then there was the time Trump dismissed the unemployment rate as  phony,  which was under 5 percent during the campaign, only to brag about the same numbers when the first jobs reports came out under his presidency.Then there s healthcare, which Trump bragged would be easy to deal with during the campaign. He promised Americans would get cheap healthcare. Now, he admits it s  complicated  after failing to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act.Trump also failed to cripple a Syrian air base he ordered bombed. Botched a raid in Yemen that left a soldier, an American girl, and many civilians dead. His two immigration bans have been blocked by the courts, and a government shutdown looms because Trump refuses to budge on funding his useless border wall.In the end, Tapper also hit Trump for complaining about executive orders during the campaign, only to sign 25 within his first 100 days, more than any president since World War II. In fact, Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than President Obama. Trump is also on pace to take more vacations days, spend more taxpayer dollars on those vacation days, and play more rounds of golf.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a loser. That s the one word that best sums up Trump and his disastrously embarrassing first three months in office.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 25, 2017"
" For Bannon, The Losses Just Keep Coming","Steve Bannon is portrayed as the Grim Reaper on Saturday Night Live. There is a  President Steve Bannon  meme out there from coverage of the controversial advisor. In reality, his influence seems to be headed nowhere but down. First, he totally blew President Donald Trump s health care initiative. Then, his influence waned further when he openly seemed to fight with son-in-law Jared Kushner and urged the president to not take action in Syria. Now, Trump has even backpedaled on this demands that Congress fund the wall between the United States and Mexico, against the wishes of Steve Bannon.The border wall with Mexico was a big part of the Trump campaign. All of his rallies included a session of chanting with the audience of  Build the Wall!  For his part, Trump never acknowledged that Mexico is never going to pay for this expensive wall. It is also part of Bannon s dreams for the United States. His worldview, which was front and center during the president s Inaugural Address, needs this wall.Bannon is so enamored by the wall that he was pushing for a government shutdown to get Congress to include funding for it. Clearly, he learned nothing from the healthcare debacle where he told Trump to try to strong arm Congress into passing their bill because Trump wanted them to. Bannon s lack of experience dealing with our legislative branch is clear. As a co-equal branch of government, its members are never going to do something just because the White House tells them to. If you are thinking Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pushed through Neil Goresuch s nomination because of this kind of work, you miss the win it gave McConnell.This week, Bannon told his supporters,  This is a stand worth taking. We re drawing a line in the sand.

Most of those so-called  accomplishments  are executive orders that do squat, he hasn t managed to get any legislation through Congress at all, and his approval rating is at a record-low 41 percent.Other presidents fared much better during their first 100 days, and some people, like Jimmy Carter s presidential library, won t hesitate to needle Trump with their own statistics. Observe:Jimmy Carter s first 100 days..Laws passed: 22 Executive orders: 16 Approval rating: 63 percent  Jimmy Carter Library (@CarterLibrary) April 24, 2017By contrast, Trump has signed 23 executive orders that he s claiming are accomplishments, such as a federal hiring freeze. Wow. Putting a halt to hiring federal workers is so difficult, is it not?He s also trumpeting his job creation  successes,  which include greenlighting both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and his  buy American, hire American  initiative. Neither of these orders is really going to accomplish anything. Nor will his  buy American steel  initiative considering that the pipelines have long since purchased their steel, and most of it isn t American.He s touting the wall as an accomplishment too, even though Congress isn t likely to fund it, and he s listing his Muslim ban, which has been halted in federal court and has likewise done nothing.Indeed, all he can really claim as an accomplishment at all is getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.

" NC GOP Judge Leaves Bench In DISGUST, Gives Corrupt GOP Legislature A MASSIVE F-You (DETAILS)","North Carolina GOP Judge J. Douglas McCullough has had enough of doing the bidding of a corrupt, GOP-controlled legislature who is attempting to do all it can to make sure that newly-elected Democratic Governor Roy Cooper has no power. So, what did Judge McCulloough do? He resigned. In his seat will be Democratic Judge John Arrowood. Judge McCullough has been on the bench since President Ronald Reagan put him there, but clearly his abrupt decision to leave means that he is one of the few Republicans who still puts country ahead of party.Ever since Governor Cooper took over from the nightmare that was Republican Governor Pat McCrory, the GOP-controlled legislature has been steadily doing all it can to make sure that Gov. Cooper is nothing more than a figurehead. One way in which they were doing that was to try to keep Gov. Cooper from appointing judges, as is his right as governor.In order to circumvent this, the state legislature introduced a bill that would change the number of judges on the North Carolina Court of Appeals from 15 to 12. The bill, House Bill 239, would make sure that Cooper would not get to appoint the replacements for the judges that are approaching the age at which judges in North Carolina are required to retire. Of course, Gov. Cooper vetoed the ridiculous bill, but the Republicans have a veto-proof majority, so they would have just overridden it.Judge McCullough was aware that he would be at the aforementioned required retirement age in just 36 days, so instead of stepping down and going through the formal nomination process on that date, he made sure that Gov. Cooper got his rightful appointment. As an extra thumb at the Republicans, Judge Arrowood also happens to be openly gay   the first openly gay judge on the Court of Appeals.In his very short resignation letter, Judge McCullough explained his actions: I did not want my legacy to be the elimination of a seat and the impairment of a court that I have served on. Thank you, Judge McCullough, for doing the right thing here. Republicans in this nation care only about power and partisanship, not about country. Thank you for being one of the good guys. Maybe a few others will follow in your footsteps and put country first as well.Featured image via The Advocate (Cooper)/Loiacono Literary Agency (McCullough)",News,"April 25, 2017"

Again, I don t know if that s what killed her, I m sure it was a culmination of years and years of doing it that might have had something to do with it. She just never found her way,  he said, revealing that he had tried to get her help many years ago. How do you help somebody that doesn t want to help themselves?  he asked rhetorically.

What was offensive was his harsh judgment of, regardless of how she died, a sick woman. Baio, like most Republicans these days, believes that he is holier than thou and like Trump, when called out on it, lashes out and blames the  fake media.

 Republicans Just RUINED Trump’s Plan To Bully The Government Into Funding Border Wall (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has just been screwed over by members of his own party, thanks to his insistence on a border wall that is absolutely pointless and won t actually work.At Congress has been at a standstill over including Trump s border wall in government spending, Republican lawmakers are now agreeing with Democrats by supporting a  clean  spending bill so the government won t have to stop working on Friday. This push takes Trump s border wall out of the running for funding.Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) said: Ideological litmus tests on a spending bill like this simply create partisan roadblocks. With so many pressing issues facing our country, we need to work together to keep the lights on and avoid another expensive shutdown that weakens not only our economy but our national security. Mick Mulvaney, who is Trump s budget director, tried to make a deal with Congress by promising that Obamacare would get more funding if Trump s wall was funded. Clearly okay with manipulating Americans into funding a wall that no one wants, Mulvaney said: We d offer them $1 of CSR [Obamacare] payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. No one in the Democratic party actually wants this border wall to be funded   and Chuck Schumer pointed out exactly why. These are points that even Republicans can t argue with:A spokesman for Schumer blasted the Trump administration for trying to use Obamacare to bribe lawmakers into funding Trump s wall: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.The US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and, according to the President, Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall. If the administration would drop their 11th hour demand for a wall that Democrats, and a good number of Republicans oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Trump needs to just admit that the border wall he promised his brainless supporters was a flawed idea, and it is only going to cost America in the end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Republicans Are Secretly TERRIFIED That Trump Is Already Handing Congress To The Democrats,"How bad is Trump for the GOP? It seems he s worse than many would have guessed. As his 100th day in office approaches, more people are noticing that he s gotten nothing done. And the party is starting to realize just how much of a problem this could be. Lawmakers who are up for election every two years pretty much never stop campaigning, and the parties are always working on the next election.But the Republican Party is having trouble finding candidates who will commit to running for 2018. According to Politico: Potential GOP candidates whom party leaders want to recruit are afraid of walking into a buzz saw, uncertain about what kind of political environment they ll be facing by the time the midterms come around   and what Trump s record will look like But interviews with more than a dozen top Republican operatives, donors and officials reveal a growing trepidation about how the initial days of the new political season are unfolding. And they underscore a deep anxiety about how the party will position itself in 2018 as it grapples with the leadership of an unpredictable president still acclimating to Washington. Trump and his mouthpieces keep assuring the press that things are humming along and that he s already accomplished a great deal. If they re talking about all the executive orders, then Zac Petkanas has some harsh words for them. According to him, all those EOs are just theater   a way to look like he s doing something:.@Zac_Petkanas on @POTUS  first 100 days:  Most of these executive orders, they re theater It is the perception of activity.  #first100 pic.twitter.com/XwFUxFLrYC  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 24, 2017They re also worried about vacant House seats in deep red states. Jon Ossof, in Georgia, very narrowly lost his special election outright and will proceed to a runoff in June against Republican candidate Karen Handel. In Kansas, the Democratic candidate made it a much closer race than it otherwise should have been.Democrats who don t really vote all that much have been turning out for these elections at a far higher rate than Republicans who don t vote too much. Furthermore, not only is Trump s approval rating at a record low for this point in his administration, but Congress  own approval rating   particularly that of Republicans   has fallen sharply since February, too. A big part of that is their failure to pass their healthcare bill along with the looming shutdown threat.In other words, 2018 is starting to look like a referendum on Trump and his sheer incompetence. And that has Republicans running scared.Good.Featured image by Aude Guerrucci-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Donald Trump Just Used The World Trade Center Collapsing To Brag About Himself (FULL QUOTE),"It s become more than obvious that Donald Trump has absolutely no filter when he speaks. He says exactly what is on his mind, and as it would appear, he may even believe his own lies.What Trump also seems to believe, is that he s the best thing that ever happened to the world and we should all be grateful to be alive during his existence on the planet. He s obsessed with how much people either like him or don t like him, and what he s most obsessed with is ratings. He seems to live for ratings and how many people saw him at any particular time. It s very pathetic that he seems to need this gratification.However, in a recent unfiltered moment from Trump, he compared himself to 9/11/01 and the ratings  Face the Nation  got covering the World Trade Center collapsing.In an interview with The Associated Press, as they spoke with Trump, they said: And that s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people  This is when Trump decided to say: No I have, it s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning. Um, ok  and AP responded with,  I remember, right.  However, Trump wasn t done. He continued: It had 9.2 million people. It s the highest they ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS  Face the Nation  host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It s the highest for  Face the Nation  or as I call it,  Deface the Nation.  It s the highest for  Deface the Nation  since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It s a tremendous advantage. He then went off on a tangent about the  fake news  or whatever.The fact that he s comparing, and randomly so, his ratings on a show to the coverage of the World Trade Center collapsing isn t only bizarre, it s depraved. He s literally trying to say that he s so popular, he can beat the ratings of the worst domestic disaster on American soil. Not only that, he says this after making a terrible joke.What the f**k is wrong with him? This is about as shameful as one could EVER possibly get.Featured photo via Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 DISGUSTING GOP Plan Would Make People Prove They Are Worthy Of Healthcare,"Poverty is a moral failure, don t you know? Being born rich is the only thing that washes away all sins (or is it that rich people are born without sin?), at least that s the attitude of modern Republicans. Kentucky s governor, though, has a solution for that. Like a child earning an allowance, Governor Matt Bevin devised a chart where people can earn points with good behavior and those points would help them cover health care costs.The plan, which sounds more like a virtual punch card you might use at a Marriott, rather than one for attaining healthcare, is called  MyRewards Account.  MyRewards Account is a list of hoops that poor people have to jump through before they earn enough points to get dental or eye exams. Bevin is selling it as an expansion of benefits, when in reality, it s a humiliating way to make the most basic human right of healthcare as a carrot with a huge stick attached to it.The biggest change is Bevin s proposal to charge premiums for Medicaid and impose an annual $1,000 deductible before the program covers beneficiaries  health care costs. Those are big price hikes for people who can t afford them. Similar policies have driven down insurance rates and harmed public health outcomes in other states already.Source: Think ProgressThe plan would give petty sums of money to be used toward healthcare benefits that Kentuckyians currently enjoy for doing things like try to find a job, when in fact, most Medicaid recipients do have jobs. It also rewards people for not smoking or for having  no inappropriate ER visits.  You d better hope that isn t really indigestion before claiming you might be having a heart attack.CREDIT: Kentucky HEALTH Program Requirements SpecificationObviously, this intrusive and completely unjust plan has more than a few critics, including anyone who cares at all about personal liberties (isn t that what these Ayn Rand humpers are all about?) This requires building a massive database about people s individual behaviors, and then keeping it up. Never mind that it s massively expensive, it also feels very invasive,  former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Andy Slavitt said in an interview.  I m not sure the government should be tracking if I put on five pounds, or if I m advancing in my job, or what grade I got on my GED exam. The party that doesn t seem concerned at all that their president hasn t even provided his tax returns see no hypocrisy in their insistence that the poor live under a microscope. The poor are not children who need constant suprevision, they are adults are deserve to be treated as such. Remember, Christians, Jesus was poor.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Runs Full Page Ad For Mar-a-Lago Across Several Government Websites,"Visitors to several government websites may notice that there is an article popping up highlighting Mar-a-Lago   which is odd because Mar-a-Lago isn t government property, its a private resort owned and managed by Donald Trump himself. Burrowing into the article, a reader may notice that the piece isn t written in a dry, serious tone befitting a governmental agency, its one glorified advertisement for the place Trump and his family exclusively profit from which places a positive spin on Trump s Mar-a-Lago profiteering.Right from the start, the marketing angle is obvious. It, like Trump, insists on calling Mar-a-Lago the  Winter White House  a term made up by Trump to justify his numerous vacations to Florida. Nobody agreed to label Mar-a-Lago the  winter White House  and given its lack of security and the way it profits from Trump s access, calling it a White House is in all likelihood illegal. Nevertheless, Trump and writer Leigh Hartman insist.Mar-a-Lago, President Trump s Florida estate, has become well known as the president frequently travels there to work or host foreign leaders.The first meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will take place April 6 7 at Mar-a-Lago, which is located at the heart of Florida s Palm Beach community.From his base at Mar-a-Lago, Trump has golfed over a dozen times at a golf course he owns in Florida. He does not, by any account, do much  work  while he is there. In at least one example, Trump s morning filled with  meetings  turned out to be Trump s attempt to bingewatch golf in an empty dining room with two friends.Someone just posted this on Instagram from Trump's golf club. POTUS appears to be watching Golf Channel with 2 other people. pic.twitter.com/5LpVRHR1Do  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) March 26, 2017The article only gets more absurd from there.After refurbishing the house and adding an events space, Trump opened the estate to dues-paying members of the public in 1995 as the Mar-a-Lago Club.Post s dream of a winter White House came true with Trump s election in 2016. Trump regularly works out of the house he maintains at Mar-a-Lago and uses the club to host foreign dignitaries. Dues-paying members of the public  is code for  rich people.  Those members now have untold access to Donald Trump and many have been seen dining near Trump while the president discusses sensitive, sometimes classified information. They giddily share their brushes with Trump on social media, including once photographing the military staffer in charge of carrying the  nuclear football.  On Trump s end, he does much to entertain the people who pay him. Before the annual White House egg roll, Trump threw a private Easter party for rich families at Mar-a-Lago the night before.VIPs come first pic.twitter.com/75hLNSIFk2  southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) April 16, 2017And in case readers didn t understand why they should pay to go there, here is a fluffy description of the features:When socialite and cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post built Mar-a-Lago   Spanish for  Sea to Lake    in 1927, she spared no expense. The 114-room mansion sits on 8 hectares of land, with the Atlantic Ocean on one side and an inland waterway on the other.The ornate Jazz Age house was designed with Old-World Spanish, Venetian and Portuguese influences and decorated with Post s personal collection of antiques.It s baffling to think why this advertisement for Mar-a-Lago would be allowed on any government website, but it has shown up on at least two. It seems to have originated on  Share America,  a website run by the State Department with pro-America articles written in the vein of  Upworthy.  From there it was posted inexplicably on the website for the U.S. Embassy in the United Kingdom. No other articles of this nature show up on that website. The Mar-a-Lago promo seems to be unique.It s hard to imagine this isn t blatantly illegal. Trump s private business is once again getting a major boost thanks to the government Trump now believes he controls. It s like cranking his conflict of interest violations up to 11.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Threatens Government Shutdown If Congress Doesn’t Approve Billions To Fund His Border Wall,"Donald Trump and the Republicans are about to prove once and for all that they are incapable of governing.Despite having control of Congress and the White House, Republicans are on the verge of causing a government shutdown because Trump is demanding that funding for his useless border wall be included in the budget.The deadline to pass a new budget is Friday, when the temporary funding bill that was passed in December expires.Over the weekend, Trump s budget director Mick Mulvaney made it clear that Trump is obsessed with funding the massive wall and that not funding the project would be unacceptable. This suggests that Trump will veto any budget that does not include it. We ve finally boiled this negotiation down to something we want very badly that the Democrats really don t like and that s the border wall,  Mulvaney claimed.  At the same time, there s something they want very badly that we don t like very much, which are these cost-sharing reductions in the Obamacare payments. Trump followed up with a series of tweets on Sunday.ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going   otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017The Democrats don t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017Yes, Mulvaney and Trump are literally threatening to take healthcare away from Americans if Democrats and Republicans continue to refuse to waste taxpayer dollars on a wall that won t do anything to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing into the country.As the Berlin Wall demonstrated, people will still find a way to cross the border if they are desperate enough, even at the risk of death.Also, the number of people crossing the border illegally is already way down and has been for some time. The number was even dropping while President Obama was in office. The drop in the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border makes Trump s wall even more unnecessary.The wall would not only cost billions to build, it s likely that a Mexican company would be contracted to do the work and it would irreparably harm migration patterns of animals and destroy habitats.Overall, the wall is a bad idea. But Trump is desperate to achieve anything as his first 100 days come to a close. Trump made a lot of promises about what he would do in his first 100 days, and the border wall was his top promise.But the wall is an unpopular idea as well. Only 28 percent of Americans support it, and Republicans and Democrats in the Southwest agree that it shouldn t be built.If Trump and Republicans continue to insist on wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall, a government shutdown is inevitable and Democrats won t be at fault.The last two major government shutdowns were in 1995 and 2013. In both instances, a Democrat was in the White House. But Republicans controlled Congress in 1995 and controlled the House in 2013 while Democrats controlled the Senate, albeit without a 60-vote majority and the fact that Republicans obstructed everything.The point is, however, that the American people blamed Republicans for both of those shutdowns. And they will definitely blame Republicans again because Republicans control the White House and Congress this time.Republicans are literally facing a no-win scenario.Republicans in the House and Senate NEED Democrats in order to pass Trump s wall funding because 60 votes are needed in the Senate and it s likely that hardline conservatives will vote against the budget in the House.And since many Republicans also don t support the wall, it s looking like Trump will have to be the one to back down and we all know that Trump doesn t like backing down. And that means he will be the one responsible for causing a government shutdown that will hurt our country, no matter hard hard he tries to pin the blame on Democrats. Democrats do not control Congress, nor do they control the White House. This is all on Trump and Republicans.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Insists He Would Still Beat Hillary In The Popular Vote Even Though He Lost By A Landslide,"Donald Trump is still delusional and Twitter users were quick to remind him of who lost the popular vote in November.It s been almost six months since the 2016 Election concluded in November, but Trump is still under the delusion that he won the popular vote and is insisting that he would still win if another election were held.In a pair of tweets on Sunday, Trump declared that the ABC News/Washington Post poll is  fake news  even though the poll showed that most Trump supporters don t regret their vote and that a slim majority approve of his foreign policy and his pressure on American companies to keep jobs here. Apparently, Trump only believes polls are fake when the numbers are against him.For instance, his approval rating is the lowest for any president since 1945 in the first 100 days. And most Americans don t trust him.Trump also liked the part of the poll that suggests he would win the popular vote if the election were held again.New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative.

 Trump Loses Track Of His Rant Mid-Meltdown Just As Questions Over His Mental Health Resurface,"One Twitter user it put it this way: Thanks to his love of social media, we are watching the President of the United States have a mental collapse right in front of our eyes. In real time. It may explain why psychologists have noted a steep rise in cases of anxiety since the election. The man in charge   already the least qualified in U.S. history   is plainly not well.And speculation over Trump s mental health has only gotten worse since the release of a damning Associated Press interview in which he seems incapable of stringing together even a single coherent sentence. The full transcript is depressingly bonkers, but here s a taste:TRUMP: OK. The one thing I ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don t watch CNN anymore.AP: You just said you did.TRUMP: No. No, I, if I m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)?AP: You just said  TRUMP: Where? Where?AP: Two minutes ago.And here s another:You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we re going to be doing major tax reform. Here s part of your story, it s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody s saying,  Oh, he s delaying.  I m not delaying anything. I ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That s another thing that really has   I ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said,  Well the one thing good is now I ll get good press.  And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.The interview goes on like that   a rambling, incoherent word salad   for its entire duration. Adding to that is Trump s own Twitter behavior, which has gone from unhinged to something far more unsettling. He s at the point where his persecution complex, or his anger, or his mental health crisis has reached such an intensity that he can t even remember to finish his 140 character thoughts. This morning, Trump woke up still angry that he s the most unpopular president at his 100-day mark in America s history. He lashed out.The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If  Donald J.

 ‘He’s Not Doing What I Thought’: Voters Pissed Off Over Wasting Their Vote On Trump (VIDEO),"During a sit down with Trump voters, CNN got their take on the alleged president s first 100 days. With polls showing Trump as the most unpopular president in history, some of the former reality show star s most ardent supporters have stood by him but others are fed up. One Trump supporter has had it with Trump s broken promises, such as the vow to work on the opioid epidemic spreading across America. Another Trump voter, Scott McCommons, said that he was  disappointed  with Trump s first 100 days, calling it was a  disaster. He s got enough time to get on Twitter, and rant and rave, and on top of that lie on Twitter,  he said.  I voted for the man to make America great again, and I m willing to give him a chance, but he s not doing what I thought, that he made promises at rallies that I went to. I expected him to work a little harder [on health care],  he continued.  Be a little more reasonable instead of threatening people. That s unpresidential. I voted to send him to Washington strictly because I thought he would make change, nobody would push him around. He s used his power against people, I think that s wrong. gt s been a disaster, I think, in the first 100 days. If I were to vote tomorrow, I would not vote for him,  he added.Watch courtesy of CNN:As the CNN host pointed out, Trump campaigned as the ultimate deal maker. One strong supporter of Trump s blamed House Speaker Paul Ryan for that. McCommons said Trump  isn t willing to sit down at the table and negotiate. If only Trump supporters were warned that the alleged billionaire was a con man. Oh wait, they were.

 WATCH: Nebraska Farmer Politely SHREDS Every Last Pro-Keystone XL Talking Point Fox News Host Has,"Landowners in Nebraska are understandably upset about the Trump administration greenlighting Keystone XL because it will run near or through their lands, most of which are farms. One man, Art Tanderup, who has a small, 160-acre farm in the path of Keystone XL, appeared on Fox News to discuss the problem. And he proved that he knows much more about it than the talking heads who keep trumpeting how great it is.Tanderup leads a group of 90 Nebraska farmers who are suing to stop Keystone XL s construction. When host Sandra Smith asked him if this was a  not in my backyard  thing, and whether he would fight it this aggressively if it wasn t in his backyard, he replied with: Yes we would. After we learned how destructive the chemicals in the tar sands are, we have come to realize that this type of fossil fuel should not be happening, and it doesn t matter where it s at. We need to look for other sources of renewable energy. Smith also asked him what the group s goals are, and he said: Our goal is to keep this pipeline out of the eastern sand hills of Nebraska and off the Ogallala aquifer. Our premium goal would be to leave the tar sands in the ground and move more rapidly to renewable fuels. There was discussion about the quality of tar sands oil, which is terrible   tar sands oil is dirty as hell, and refining it produces a byproduct that s worse than coal when burned (and guess what? We sell that byproduct to China, who then burns it!). It also only produces poor quality fuel, and Trans Canada would be sending it through the pipeline to Texas for refining, after which it would be exported overseas. We get no benefit at all except for possibly a few new jobs at a refinery.Smith tried to make the pipeline sound safer than rail when it comes to moving oil, and it is, but Tanderup even shot down that talking point. It was like she never even heard him say that his group believes the tar sands should stay where they are, or really, anything else he said.Watch below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 24, 2017"
 The GOP Congress Just Moved To Let Big Banks And The Super Rich Screw You Over,"The biggest threat to the oligarchy is for the  little guy  to have a voice, any type of voice. Republicans hate when poor people, especially minorities, vote, and now they want to restrict the way we can vote with our money.The bill, which would eliminate the banking regulations made law in 2010, as a response to the near collapse of the economy, in Dodd-Frank. As if that wasn t bad enough, there s an easter egg in the bill that would for all intents and purposes, silence small investors.Under current law, any investor, as long as they own about $2,000 in stocks, has the right to attend shareholder meetings and file proposals. In other words, any investor has a voice in how a company is run. Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R) chairs the House Financial Services Committee and his bill, which would replace Dodd-Frank, would also limit the number of people who have a voice to at most 100 people. Under his bill, only shareholders who own at least one percent of the company have any voice at all.That doesn t sound huge but think about it for a moment. Exxon is worth $392 billion. To have a voice at all, you would need to own almost $4 billion in stock. That means that if you aren t happy with Exxon s drilling practices, the company will tell you to screw yourself.If you think shareholders are generally already sympathetic to the direction of any given company, you d be wrong. There are many examples throughout history of shareholders forcing companies to do the right thing.Here s just one example:Appalled by a Bloomberg Markets Magazine cover story that linked American steel company Nucor Corp. to pig iron suppliers in Brazil who used slave labor, an investment firm with a stake in Nucor called for corrective action. Their mechanism: a shareholder resolution. The proposal appeared on Nucor s 2009 proxy statement prior to a yearly shareholder meeting   and 27 percent of the company s shareholders voted in favor it.Nucor stalled at first, but within a year, the steelmaker told the stakeholding company, Domini Social Investments LLC (now Domini Impact Investments) that it had begun requiring its manufacturers to sign an agreement with a group of nongovernmental organizations, including a pledge to break ties altogether with the suppliers using forced labor.Source: IB TimesShareholders have also been quite effective at forcing companies to be more environmentally friendly.Just who are these soon to be disenfranchised shareholders? Well, they can be anyone with a 401K or a pension. In other words, they can be you or me.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Won’t Give Sean Spicer The Boot Because ‘That Guy Gets Great Ratings’,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a trainwreck. After all, this is the guy who said Hitler really wasn t that bad. Everybody tunes in daily to see what ridiculous assertion will come out of his mouth this time, and apparently, that is all the job security he needs in Donald Trump s administration.According to the Washington Post, Trump has no intention of firing Spicer because he  gets great ratings,  and in Trump s White House, ratings matter far more than facts. The WaPo article explores Trump s obsession with cable news and revealed that Spicer s job is safe as long as he can keep people turning in to watch him crash and burn. I m not firing Sean Spicer,  Trump said, according to sources.  That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The Washington Post reports that  most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times  CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.  The article also noted that  during an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing. Spicer has become a laughing stock. Saturday Night Live has had a blast lampooning him in recent months, with Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the press secretary. The fact that Spicer was portrayed on SNL by a woman seemed to be more upsetting to Trump than any of Spicer s numerous gaffes.The press secretary kicked off his very first press conference by claiming that Trump s inauguration really didn t have a pathetic turnout, despite pictures proving he was full of it. And things have only gone downhill from there. But as long as America keeps tuning in for Spicer s daily dumpster fires press briefings, he can rest assured that Trump is going to keep him around.

 Yale Professor Explains Exactly Why We Need To Compare Trump To Hitler,"In the late 20th Century, author and attorney Mike Godwin said that  as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches.  Soon, though,  Godwin s Law  was used to invalidate any mention of Hitler, which effectively worked to white-wash a significant portion of 20th century history.Who knows, that could be why we re seeing a rise in holocaust denial and the election of Donald Trump. Now, a Yale Professor is taking on that very issue, saying that our fear of making Hitler comparisons is making us historically illiterate.Yale history professor, and author of  On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,  Timothy Snyder isn t going so far to say that Trump is like Hitler, but he is saying that there are a lot of lessons to be learned from Hitler, specifically in how democratic republics fail and that our refusal to even talk about Hitler simply feeds our intellectual laziness.So the way to start the discussion about comparisons is to point out that Americans are extremely lazy about history. I mean that s one way in which were definitely number one among major nations. And one of the ways we re lazy about history is that as soon as anyone suggests that the past might be useful, then we say  but wait it s not exactly the same and therefore I m just going to discard it.  In that way in two or three seconds we give ourselves an excuse not to think about history.Source: Business InsiderHere s the video:var playerParam = {'pcode':'BhdmY6l9g002rBhQ6aEBZiheacDu','playerBrandingId':'6e12e8b3387a44daacfb73afba25a76e','skin': {'config': '//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/latest/skin-plugin/skin.json'} };OO.ready(function() {window.pp = OO.Player.create('container', 'B1MWNzYTE6PYNvENSzDs8rjZyVjOKMu8', playerParam);        });The main reason for studying history, other than the fact that it s fascinating as hell, is to learn from what our forebears got wrong as well as from what they got right. Clearly, a hell of a lot went wrong during the late part of the 19th Century and the first half of the 20th Century. There were the robber barons, there was the Great Depression and there was the rise of fascism that killed millions of people. Perhaps if we weren t so lazy about history, we wouldn t need to talk about income inequality and banks wouldn t be too big to fail. If Mike Godwin hadn t been so wildly misinterpreted, perhaps we would not have have been silenced when comparing Trump s white nationalist following to that of Hitler. Instead, neo-nazis are now an actual voting bloc and the nation s press secretary can conveniently ignore the fact that Hitler gassed six million Jews. Hey, at least Spicer is getting us to talk about history.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 Delusional Trump Hilariously Thinks Angela Merkel Likes Him (DETAILS),"We all remember the absolutely disastrous visit Donald Trump had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He infamously made her look at him like he had lost his mind when joked about her allegedly being wiretapped by the Obama Administration while he was busy trying to defend his own false claims that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, refused to shake Merkel s hand during a photo op, and even tried to give her a bill for NATO worth billions of dollars.Trump, however, seems to have a very different memory of his visit with the German leader. While speaking of the visit with the Associated Press, Trump said: Yeah, it s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with Merkel. As if that weren t ridiculous enough, considering that the whole world saw how that visit actually went, Trump continued, this time trying to excuse his rudeness with the handshake debacle: And I guess somebody shouted out,  Shake her hand, shake her hand,  you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time. He went on to boast: Because, um, I m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I m at odds on immigration. Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 Fox News Rails Against Media Coverage of Trump’s First 100 Days – Here’s How They Covered Obama’s,"Donald Trump s media mouthpiece, Fox News, is trying to put a positive spin on his terrible first 100 days, just like Reince Priebus and Trump himself. Part of what Fox is doing seems to be taking to Twitter to loudly complain about how the rest of the media has covered his first 100 days. Needless to say, they are very unhappy that the media s coverage has been overwhelmingly negative. To them, this demonstrates a very obvious hatred of Trump:The media s 100-day war against @POTUS. pic.twitter.com/orcTyETvzt  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017Study: 89% of broadcast news coverage of the Trump Administration has been negative. pic.twitter.com/bSV5vCoDZZ  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017TV News pushed relentlessly negative agenda. pic.twitter.com/G09jhqdra3  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017But this is because it s Trump. Fox News was similarly negative during Obama s first 100 days. According to George Mason University s Center for Media Affairs, Bret Baier s  Special Report  only gave positive coverage to Obama 23 percent of the time (they analyzed  Special Report  because it most closely resembles traditional broadcast news). 77 percent of their coverage was negative.Overall, only 21 percent of Fox s total coverage was positive, and that number dropped to 15 percent when discussing his policies.Perhaps more than that, though, is the fact that Fox declared their opposition to Obama as quickly as they could. In April of 2009, they were openly urging their viewers to get involved in Tea Party protests against President Obama s fiscal policy.Furthermore, they weren t afraid to use words like socialism, fascism, Marxism and even communism. They uttered those words 1,400 times during Obama s first 100 days, or 14 times per day.So really, where do they get off whining about how the media s covering Trump? The fact of the matter is that Trump has actually been a complete disaster since he got elected. His proposals are literally impossible, he thought he could strongarm both Congress and hostile world leaders into falling in line behind him, and he s spent more time golfing in his first 100 days than Obama spent in his entire first year. Calling all this out is part of the media s job.Photo of Donald Trump by Mark Wilson/Getty Images. Photo of President Obama by Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Heartlessly Tells A Mother That If Her Son Wants Healthcare He Should Get A Better Job,"Wow. The cruelty of Republicans knows no bounds.Apparently, Republicans truly believe that healthcare is a privilege that only people with money should be able to receive.That s basically what Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson told a mother who expressed her concern that her son won t have healthcare coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.The woman s son works in the service industry, which usually does not provide health insurance to workers. Pay is also low enough that workers qualify for Medicaid, a program that Republicans fiercely oppose because it benefits low-income Americans.Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, her son did not have health insurance. He, like millions of other Americans, could not afford it. But the Medicaid expansion finally gave him the healthcare coverage he desperately needed. Now that is being threatened by Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable, decent health care that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working?  the mother asked Davidson at a town hall event on Tuesday.Davidson responded by giving a heartless answer that resulted in a round of boos and jeers from the crowd in attendance. OK, I don t know anything about your son, but as you described him, his skills are focused in an industry that doesn t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care. So, I don t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled to give that to him. I believe he s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits. First of all, service industry workers pay taxes, too. So they have every right to be covered by Medicaid. Second, healthcare is a right that everyone should have regardless of where they work or what industry they work in. Third, there are not enough of the kind of jobs Davidson is talking about to provide everyone in this country with workplace-provided healthcare coverage benefits. And finally, if Davidson and his Republican colleagues got off their asses and passed a law requiring the multi-billion dollar service industry to provide healthcare to their workers or pay their workers enough so they can afford to buy good health insurance plans themselves, this woman s son and millions of others would not have to live in fear of losing their coverage.But Davidson literally told this woman to tell her son to get a different job. And he dug the hole deeper for himself by compare health insurance to cell phones. If he doesn t want a catastrophic care plan, don t buy a catastrophic care plan. If you don t want a flip-phone, don t buy a flip-phone,  Davidson said. Once again, the crowd reacted in total disgust.Buying a cell phone is NOT the same as buying health insurance, and it s time for Republicans to that through their thick skulls.Health insurance costs hundreds of dollars a month or more while a cell phone payment plan is relatively cheap.In response to Davidson s remark, the woman snapped back and then walked away with the knowledge that her own congressman doesn t give a damn about her or her family. I m sorry, health care is much different than a cell phone and I m tired of people using cell phone analogies with health care,  she said.Here s the video via YouTube.

 Lying Liar Reince Priebus Says Trump Is Fulfilling Pledges At ‘Breakneck Speed’ (VIDEO),"Even though amateur president Donald Trump will likely reach the 100-day mark of his alleged presidency with no notable legislation while his contract  with the American voter  still sits on his website, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday on NBC s  Meet the Press  that the former reality show star is fulfilling his campaign promises at  breakneck speed. And then, as if he had never met members of his own party before, Priebus blamed  historical unbelievable obstruction  from Democratic senators for the hundreds of jobs throughout the federal government the Trump s administration has failed to fill, according to Talking Points Memo:Republicans aren t called the  party of no  for no reason.In late January of 2009 after former President Barack Obama took office, this happened:The Republicans were pumped because they saw a path out of the political wilderness. They were convinced that even if Obama kept winning policy battles, they could win the broader messaging war simply by remaining unified and fighting him on everything. Their conference chairman, a then-obscure Indiana conservative named Mike Pence, underscored the point with a clip from Patton, showing the general rallying his troops for war against their Nazi enemy:  We re going to kick the hell out of him all the time! We re going to go through him like crap through a goose! From day one, Congressional Republicans made opposing Obama a political strategy. And now, one of those Republicans, Mike Pence, is vice-president.Here is Trump s  breakneck  speed at breaking promises:The Muslim ban was not implemented. Hillary Clinton will not be locked up. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly promised that he would declare China a currency manipulator immediately after he took office and now he says,  They re not currency manipulators.  Trump said he will build a wall on the US-Mexico border, and Mexico will pay for it. Mexico is not paying for it. The taxpayers are. Trump s campaign website stated, (It has since been deleted but the Internet is forever)  On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.  Trump promised to Drain the Swamp, but instead filled it up with Goldman Sachs alumni. Trump said he would give the military s top generals 30 days to submit a plan for defeating ISIS and that hasn t happened.And that s just the short list. To be sure, we re glad those promises, aside from that swamp issue, are unfulfilled. But facts matter and Reince is lying.Image via screen capture. ",News,"April 23, 2017"
" Once Again, Trump Proves How INCREDIBLY Ignorant He Is About The World (DETAILS)","President Donald Trump does not know anything about foreign policy. Now, it appears, he knows just as little about trade. This is more troubling as one of his selling points was that he was a successful businessman with a global company. You d think that a person with such a vast empire (there are Trump Towers all over the planet) would know a thing or two about the subject. This idea was blown out of the water this week by comments from a German official about Chancellor Angela Merkel s recent visit to Washington, DC.The official told The Times of London, Ten times Trump asked [German chancellor Angela Merkel] if he could negotiate a trade deal with Germany. Every time she replied,  You can t do a trade deal with Germany, only the EU.  On the eleventh refusal, Trump finally got the message,  Oh, we ll do a deal with Europe then.' For a man who claimed to be able to  make the best deals  for the United States with our trading partners, it helps to know who exactly those partners are.As bad as that is, Trump s lack of world knowledge is more than just problematic when it comes to problems the country is dealing with on the other side of the world. Not only has the Trump Administration failed to even nominate an ambassador to South Korea, up until China President Xi Jinping visited him at Mar-a-Lago, he was under the impression that the only thing that had to happen to contain North Korean leader, Kim Jung Un, was have China tell him to behave.North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017After his visit with Xi, Trump told the Wall Street Journal,  After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it s not so easy. I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over] North Korea.   But it s not what you would think. Keep in mind, Trump spent a lot of time during the campaign (and before) touting,  I know China.  He claimed that the combination of the work he has done with the Chinese and the  hundreds of books  he had read about China made him an expert on the region. All of this is odd, given his comments about that short (ten minutes!) conversation. His lack of understanding goes further.After his meeting with Xi, Trump told an interviewer,  Korea actually used to be a part of China. This did not go over well with the South Korean government. South Korean foreign spokesman Cho June-hyuck responded with,  It s a clear fact acknowledged by the international community that, for thousands of years in history, Korea has never been part of China. But wait, there s more.An interview with Fox & Friends makes it appear that Trump really doesn t even know who is running North Korea right now. He told them:I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace, but you know, they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton s book, he said,  Oh we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody s been outplayed, they ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and we ll see what happens. But I just don t telegraph my moves.Bill Clinton never dealt with the current leader, he dealt with his father, Kim Jung Il. Getting these facts wrong says a lot. Trump doesn t know who to deal with when it comes to trade with Germany. He seems to have taken his information about Chinese and Korean history from Xi. He doesn t appear to have a clue as to who the leader of North Korean leader. The questions with this president are not  What did he know and when did he know it?  but  Does he know anything and can he be taught?

 Sean Hannity Loses His Sh*t After Getting His Ass Handed To Him By New York Times Writers,"It s time for Sean Hannity to join Bill O Reilly in the unemployment line.On Saturday, the New York Times published an article reporting that Donald Trump gets policy advise from Sean Hannity among many others outside the White House. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial Presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, Hannity served as Trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with Hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.Of course, Hannity had a complete meltdown on Twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the New York Times of  colluding  with Hillary Clinton and referred to them as  fake news,  which is something Trump would do.@nytimes You colluded with HRC in 2016. It s none of your business who i do or do not talk too.

Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017But he s wrong.

He also forgot that he has, indeed, spoken with the New York Times and Nick Corasaniti was kind enough to provide a link to the interview.Here s an interview I did with Sean last year: https://t.co/uUMU1yGcoe https://t.co/QzNFgNxSMi  Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) April 22, 2017Yeah, that has to be embarrassing.Anyway, the night passed and Hannity was apparently still pissed off so he imploded on Sunday morning in a series of tweets directed at the trio of writers.Maggie have you ever publicly commented on how @wikileaks revealed the @nytimes colluded with HRC?

 Trump State Campaign Chair In Hot Water For Trafficking A Kid For Sex (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is himself, a pervert. We all knew that. Despite the fact that we have audio proof of this, the  family values  party embraced him with open arms. However, the longer Trump stays in office, the more dirt that comes out about him and those associated with him. Case in point   the Kentucky state chair for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign.Tim Nolan is a member of the Board of Education of Campbell County in California, Kentucky. He is also a former judge, and he happened to run Donald Trump s state campaign there. On Friday, he was led away in handcuffs on a most disturbing charge: that he trafficked a child for sex. The local press, River City News, says that the indictment against Nolan accuses him of making a minor a victim of  commercial sexual activity.  This isn t any old scandal that just got dug up, either   Nolan allegedly was engaging in these activities while he was running Trump s campaign in the state of Kentucky in August of last year. Nolan has also been referred to by local reporters as an  outspoken and controversial  type who is constantly riding for the local Tea Party.In addition to being a child sex trafficker, Nolan is also an avowed racist who was removed from the Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission after a Ku Klux Klan photo appeared on his Facebook page. Of course, since the Trump campaign was just fine with white supremacists, Klansmen and the like, they never bothered to do anything about Nolan s association with their election efforts.Nolan s supposed misdeeds were looked into with great interest by the Campbell County Police, which resulted in this indictment. Another interesting twist is that while the crimes and indictment occurred in Campbell County, the arraignment did not happen there. Why, you might ask? Well, because it would be a conflict of interest to have him appear in a courtroom where his daughter, Taunya Nolan, is a County Court Clerk.These scandals with people surrounding Trump just keep getting sicker and sicker. After all, there was just another Trump state campaign chair, Ralph Shortey of Oklahoma, who was caught in a seedy motel room smoking weed and preparing to have sex with a teenage boy. Now, this.Wonder how many more Trump folks are going to be exposed as sexual predators? Well, considering who their boss is, there s really no telling. All we can do is pop the popcorn and wait.

 Trump Makes Total Ass Of Himself While Trying To Exploit Wounded Vet Receiving Purple Heart (VIDEO),"Donald Trump decided that he would exploit a wounded vet to make himself look good, but as usual, all he ended up doing was making a total ass out of himself. Again.Trump was visiting Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday. So he decided it would be great publicity if he personally awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sgt. 1st Class Alvaro Barrientos. Things were going pretty well until Trump congratulated him on being wounded in Afghanistan.You see, while the Purple Heart is indeed one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone serving in the U.S. military, it also means that the recipient was either wounded or killed. As such, it isn t exactly the type of thing you  congratulate  somebody on.Barrientos was one of four soldiers who was wounded when an Afghan soldier attacked their base in the Helmland province last month. As a result of his injuries, Barrientos lost his right leg, which had to be amputated at the knee. You honor that but you sure as hell don t  congratulate  it.Trump, accompanied by Melania, presented Barrientos with the Purple Heart during a small ceremony at the hospital. I heard about this and I wanted to do it myself,  said Trump.  Congratulations on behalf of Melania, myself, and the entire nation. Tremendous job. He may not think words matter, but here in the real world, they most certainly do. Especially when you are the commander-in-chief awarding the Purple Heart to a service member who just had a leg amputated fighting your country s wars. Next time Trump decides to use a wounded vet a photo-op, he should be just a bit more careful when choosing his words.You can watch Trump congratulate a wounded soldier for having his leg amputated, here:Pres.

Presumably, he expects a better turnout than he got for his pathetic inauguration.Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Rally will be to mark Trump s 100 days in office & organized/paid for by Trump s campaign committee, per senior campaign official https://t.co/wYW92Z8a87  Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) April 22, 2017So far, with 100 days under his belt, Trump hasn t managed to accomplish squat except for failing to follow through on his absurd campaign promises. Mexico isn t paying for his stupid wall. His Muslim Ban was shot down twice as bigoted and unconstitutional. Obamacare is still the law of the land. And he is known as the biggest recruiting tool ISIS has at the moment. Exactly why he thinks this warrants a party is unclear. But as can only be expected of a narcissist, he is somehow convinced that this is a great idea and it totally won t have an embarrassing turnout.It is worth pointing out that the day of Trump s  big rally  is the same night the White House Correspondents  Dinner will be taking place   without the man occupying the White House in attendance because the press hurt his feelings.On Friday, Trump tweeted that the 100-day mark is a  ridiculous standard. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017He then followed up by telling the press that it s  just an artificial barrier.  He added that since he didn t have the slightest clue how to actually president when he took office, he should be given extra leeway. He also noted that even though repealing Obamacare was one of his biggest campaign promises, he has really only been thinking about if for two months. I ve been here 92 days, but I ve only been working on the health care, you know, I had to get like a little bit of grounding, right?  Trump told the Associated Press.

 KARMA: Wikileaks Turns On Donald Trump After Administration Threatens To Arrest Julian Assange,"Karma just kicked Donald Trump s door down.As you ll recall, Donald Trump repeatedly praised Wikileaks for leaking Hillary Clinton s campaign emails.

Indeed, Trump colluded with Russia to win the election.Sessions told reporters this week that he intends to put people like Assange in jail for leaks.

And Trump has to be concerned about Wikileaks digging up information on him and releasing it to the public.This is what karma looks like.

 Trump Demotes Career State Department Official After Breitbart Questions Her Loyalty To America,"McCarthyism has returned.Donald Trump is literally letting a white nationalist publication dictate personnel decisions in his administration.Sahar Nowrouzzadeh is an American citizen of Iranian descent. She is an expert on Iran and has played a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East. She was born in America, first served at the State Department under the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and was on the team that negotiated the Iran Nuclear Deal under President Obama.But because she is of Iranian descent, Breitbart and other conservative outlets believe she is in league with Iranian leadership against the United States. Seriously.According to Politico,Nowrouzzadehad had been detailed since last July to the secretary of state s policy planning team, where she handled ongoing issues related to Iran and Gulf Arab countries. Her yearlong assignment was cut short earlier this month, after critical stories about her and others appeared in the Conservative Review and on Breitbart News, according to the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Nowrouzzadeh did not want to be reassigned, according to the official.Indeed, being reassigned is basically a demotion and one based on racism and fear instead of one based on her job performance.Nowrouzzadeh will now be working in the Office of Iranian Affairs despite the State Department praising her work as  valuable in furtherance of U.S. national security. Nowrouzzadeh is the kind of State Department employee America needs right now as tensions between Iran and the United States remain strained because Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly threatened to trash the nuclear deal.Former State Department official Phillip Gordon slammed the Trump administration for caving to pressure from conservative media. Like many civil service experts and career foreign service officers, she possesses just the sort of expertise political leaders from either party should have by their side when they make critical and difficult foreign policy decisions,  Gordon said.The bottom line is that this smacks of McCarthyism from the right-wing just as it did when Joe McCarthy led a witch hunt against government employees in pursuit of alleged communists.Only this time, conservatives are targeting anyone who has a name that sounds Middle Eastern or Muslim.Breitbart should not have the power to affect personnel decisions at the State Department and Donald Trump should not listen to them. Doing so only makes us weaker because the experts we need on the front lines are being persecuted or living in fear of being persecuted.It also makes America less safe because this demotion will be used as an example of how the current United States government treats people of Middle Eastern descent in order to recruit terrorists.Sahar Nowrouzzadeh already swore an oath to defend the United States Constitution when she was hired by the State Department in 2005. It s the same oath that members of Congress swear when they enter office. Questioning her loyalty based on the color of her skin or her birth name is wrong and constitutes discrimination. Frankly, she should file a lawsuit against Trump.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
" Sarah Palin Faced Sexual Harassment At Fox News, But She Would Rather Protect The Network Than Say Something","When high-profile women like Sarah Palin stay silent, it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted.As Fox News continues to reel in the aftermath of Bill O Reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with Roger Ailes  own sexual harassment scandal, former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there.But not Sarah Palin. Palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate.During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave Fox News was more about looking for different opportunities.TAPPER:  It sounds like you experienced something. PALIN:  I just   you know, it was just time to part ways and, and, you know, get   get out there in, I guess, a more diverse arena to express views. In fact, Palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at Fox News than she did for the perpetrators. If a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through. Sarah Palin collected a paycheck for five years (2010-2015) from Fox News as a contributor and analyst.The sexual harassment was there from the start.In 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if Palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview. Seriously.In 2011, Roger Ailes openly admitted that he only hired Palin  because she was hot and got ratings. Tucker Carlson, who has been with Fox News since 2009 and was just recently promoted to take Bill O Reilly s place, posted an incredibly sexist tweet about Palin in 2011 that he was forced to delete. Palin s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander in Milfistan,  Carlson wrote.In other words, things haven t changed much at all at Fox News. The network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one.If Palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network. And she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it. She is protecting Fox News by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk.Palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite. As a strong woman, I say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change. But Palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at Fox News, and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle.This is why Sarah Palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 22, 2017"
" Chaffetz’s Decision To Quit Means Big Trouble For Trump, And Here’s Exactly How","Congressman Jason Chaffetz s decision to leave Congress means that bad things really are on the way for President Trump. If his presidency lasts the year, I will be shocked. I will eat a hat if that happens.Chaffetz has been a real star in the GOP. He is known for his ambition. Last November, he won about 74 percent of the vote in his district. He s young. He s good looking. He knows how to get all the right press and do what he needs to do to get ahead. Nothing in his actions in the past would indicate he wanted to leave Washington, DC. At least not yet. Rumors have been going around that he had his eyes on Senator Orrin Hatch s (R-UT) seat or possibly the governor s mansion in Utah. No one expected him to leave Congress so soon after winning reelection by such a large margin.At the same time, the Congressman has not been a true believer in Trump. Last fall, after the now infamous Billy Bush tape was released, he told ABC News,  I don t plan on voting for Donald Trump   this is quite the quandary what the nation s going to have to figure out. I m out, I can t support Trump after his lewd comments.  He went on to talk about his daughters and how he could not defend what Trump said about women. He later went back on that and said that he hated what Trump did but Hillary Clinton was just so much worse.At the start of 2017, things were looking good for the young Utah politician. Chaffetz was still the chairman of the powerful House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. He had a fellow  Republican  in the White House. His Party had the House, the Senate and the White House. I can imagine him dreaming of all of the legislation he could push through this way.And then it all went wrong. Trump is not a real Republican. He has no real ideology. His only real allegiances are to his own ego and self interest. The things he says and promises he makes are valid only as long as he is voicing them. They then disappear into the proverbial ether. They have no meaning.This wasn t the problem, however. Since Inauguration Day, there have been more complaints and problems with the Trump Administration. Trump s ties to Russia are more than problematic, they could be treasonous. His financial dealings may not meet violations of law, he cannot have conflicts of interest legally. He can have them. He admitted in 2015 that he had a  big conflict of interest with Turkey because I have a hotel in Istanbul.  His frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago mean that the government is paying him every week to stay at his resort. He is still benefitting from all of his businesses and there is no reason to believe foreign leaders car a wit about the Emolument Clause. And these are just a few of the scandals that should be investigated by a committee like the one Chaffetz now heads.This has put Chaffetz in a really tough spot. He has access to information we all do not. If all of what do do know is as bad as it is, one only can wonder what things he has seen. On one hand, he cannot just step down from this committee. He cannot start investigations of a president in his own Party, especially if he knows they will blow it up. He also cannot be a party to Trump s misdeeds.This month, Chaffetz found his exit strategy. Quit Congress. He has done it slowly. First, he announces he will not seek reelection. Next, he hints that he may not serve out his term. His next move will be to quit all together. By August, he will be back in Utah. He has already taken several web domains like www.chaffetz2018.com. He claimed he wanted to be with his wife and children and that was why he was leaving. Keep in mind, his children have lived at home while he has been in Congress. That s ten years away from his kids when they lived at his house in Utah. By the summer, they will all be out of his house. So, this is when he goes back to see them more? Just after they all leave his home? No.Chaffetz sees the writing on the wall and does not want to be taken down by the same scandal that will end the Trump train wreck.Chaffetz isn t alone in this thinking. It was reported earlier this spring that Michael Steele, former chair of the RNC has been telling his clients to  start getting close to Pence. Former chairman of RNC Steele told WWR at lunch that .@RealDonaldTrump will not finish his term; advises clients to bolster ties w/VP Pence  West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) March 31, 2017Vice President Mike Pence has the same thought. His is a true believer Evangelical Christian. He once voted to take money away from HIV/AIDS funding to give it to  pray away the gay  programs. He does not go to events with women when alcohol is served, unless his wife is there. He has said he is worried he will  be tempted.  He made female staffers leave early so he would not be alone in the office with then. He could not have liked the comments that Trump grabbed women  by the pussy. Chaffetz had a bright future at the beginning of the year and the only way to make that still happen is to get the hell out of Dodge. So that s what he s doing.Featured image via Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
" American Airlines Crew Hits Woman With Stroller, Challenges Passenger To Fight (VIDEO)","Yet another example of our airline industry s awesomeness occurred Friday when an employee was captured on video challenging a passenger to a fight after a woman holding a baby was hit with her stroller. The video begins with the crying woman holding one of her children in her arms while begging for her stroller back.One angry witness can be heard saying he s  not going to sit here and watch this  before going to the front of the plane to demand the name of the employee who hit the woman. Another woman on the flight can be heard confronting the staff about their treatment of the latest victim of airline violence. Much of the staff s conversation can not be heard from the vantage point of the person filming, but the gentleman who initially confronted the thugs on the plane stands up and says you do that to me and I ll knock you flat. You stay out of this!  the male flight attendant shot back. Try it. Hit me. You don t know what the story is.  But the passenger knew what the story is (the part that matters, anyway):I don t care what the story is. You almost hit that baby!Q13 Fox spoke to some of the people aboard the plane, and the story is just as terrible as it seems:Olivia Morgan was standing in the doorway of the aircraft with her 8-year-old daughter waiting to board when the altercation happened. The flight attendant wrestled the stroller away from the woman, who was sobbing, holding one baby with the second baby in a car seat on the ground next to her,  she said.Morgan said the flight attendant was  violent  when taking the metal stroller from the woman and nearly hit the baby with the stroller. He stormed by me with the stroller and I said something like,  What are you doing? You almost hit that baby!  And he yelled at me to  stay out of it!  just like he does in the video,  she said.Morgan said she talked to the woman about the incident. The woman said a female flight attendant told her she could look for space to store the stroller because it folds up very small, but if there was no available space, she would need to check it at the gate. She was looking for space when the male attendant tried to take it away from her  and she said she told him the other attendant had told her it was okay to look,  she said.According to the American Airlines website, small strollers can be checked at the gate but there is no policy about strollers in the overhead bin. The lady and her two children were seated near the back of the plane. She was somehow able to get her stroller on board and back near her seat,  said Tom Watson, who was sitting just behind the first class section when the staff went insane. She refused to let him take it and she was almost to the point of shouting. The flight attendant and the woman started making their way to the front of the plane. They were at the front of the plane near the crew area. The woman was holding on to the stroller and refusing to let go,  he continued, adding that The flight attendant should not have been so aggressive and should have been more aware of the kids. He then says the woman was escorted off the plane.Fortunately, American Airlines seems to have learned from United s numerous blunders following employees  assault on a doctor. Rather than attempt to blame the woman, the company released a statement announcing that the employee has been suspended (not terminated though):We have seen the video and have already started an investigation to obtain the facts. What we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers. We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident. We are making sure all of her family s needs are being met while she is in our care. After electing to take another flight, we are taking special care of her and her family and upgrading them to first class for the remainder of their international trip.The actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions. The American team member has been removed from duty while we immediately investigate this incident.The woman had to take another flight, but was given upgraded accommodations.Watch video shot directly following the attack below: Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 22, 2017"
 Yale Psychiatrists Issue DIRE Warning Of The Dangers Of Allowing Trump To Continue As POTUS (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is not fit to be president. Most of the nation knows this. However, psychiatrists at Yale University   actual experts   have a warning for the United States Congress and the nation and world at large: Trump is mentally ill, and dangerously so.At a conference at the esteemed university, expressing this professional opinion was seen as a duty by this group of psychiatrists. They have described Trump as paranoid and delusional,  and that their statements were to warn of the dangers  of allowing Trump to continue to sit in the Oval Office. Dr. John Gartner, who spoke during the gathering at the School of Medicine at Yale, declared of Trump: We have an ethical responsibility to warn the public about Donald Trump s dangerous mental illness. Dr. Gartner is a member of a newly-formed organization of mental health experts called Duty to Warn. Their sole purpose is to convince as many people as possible that Donald Trump is mentally ill and must be removed from office before he does something truly dangerous to the nation and the world. Dr. Garten used Trump s ravings about his crowd sizes at his inauguration as just one piece of proof that he is too crazy to lead. He said of those statements: Worse than just being a liar or a narcissist, in addition he is paranoid, delusional and grandiose thinking and he proved that to the country the first day he was President. If Donald Trump really believes he had the largest crowd size in history, that s delusional. Dr. Bandy Lee, who teaches in the psychiatry department at Yale and headed up the conference where these statements were made, said of Trump: As some prominent psychiatrists have noted, [Trump s mental health] is the elephant in the room. I think the public is really starting to catch on and widely talk about this now. New York University psychiatrist James Gilligan had an even darker image of Trump to portray to the American people: I ve worked with some of the most dangerous people our society produces, directing mental health programs in prisons. I ve worked with murderers and rapists. I can recognize dangerousness from a mile away. You don t have to be an expert on dangerousness or spend fifty years studying it like I have in order to know how dangerous this man is. These are people who know what they are talking about. Sure, they may be violating the so-called  Goldwater Rule    meaning the unofficial rule that mental health professionals should not diagnose political figures in public   but they know what they see, and they must see something that is enough of a threat to the nation and world to speak out.Dr. Gartner has actually started a petition on the internet specifically for mental health professionals that requests that Congress exercise their Article I powers to get Trump out of the White House. It says: We, the undersigned mental health professionals (please state your degree), believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 4 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is  unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Hopefully, someone with the sense to listen to these people does something about Trump before it is too late.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson Gets Uncharacteristically Political; Says Trump Is A ‘Threat To Democracy’ (VIDEO),"Neil DeGrasse Tyson has always put science before politics, sometimes frustratingly so. Right after Trump was elected, Tyson appeared on Stephen Colbert s show, and rather than opine, he chose to try to comfort the host by saying that when you look at earth from outer space, our problems dissolve. He also said: The politician is representing an electorate. So, really, if you re against a politician, you re against their voter base, fellow citizens of this country,  he said.  So I as an educator, when I want to educate people, I don t say,  Don t vote for this person  or  Vote for that person.  I just simply educate you, so that when the time comes, you can make as informed a decision as you can. Now, though, Tyson is changing his tone. The Trump administration is clearly anti-science and it s anti-education. For Dr. Tyson, it s time to speak out   right before protesters across the nation are prepared to march for science. He posted this video to Facebook on Friday: Science is a fundamental part of the country that we are,  Tyson said.  When you have people who don t know much about science standing in denial of it and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy. While Tyson was clearly talking about Donald Trump, anti-GMO anti-vaxxer (often) liberals were taken to task as well.Tyson didn t deny that science has a place in politics. Once we agree, for example, that humans are causing climate change, we can debate how to fix the problem, but until we agree that there is a problem, we re screwed.Donald Trump s name wasn t mentioned at all during the four-minute video, and it didn t need to be. It was clear that Tyson was frustrated (dare I say angry?) that his career has been so politicized while he tries to stay on the sidelines. Tyson is a true hero.Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images.",News,"April 22, 2017"
" The White House Just Tried To Pretend Trump Was WINNING, IMMEDIATELY Regrets It (DETAILS)","Earlier today, Donald Trump whined about being held to a  ridiculous standard  in his first 100 days as POTUS, despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first 100 days. By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end. The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week. According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC. The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House. This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it. In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win. That s not going to happen, and the American people know it.

 Trump Is Trying To Force Dems’ Hand On Border Wall Funding – Here’s Why He’ll Fail BIGLY,"Donald Trump seems to think he can squeeze Congressional Democrats for border wall funding by offering them something in exchange, and he also seems to believe he s hit the jackpot on just what to exchange. He ll hold subsidy payments to insurers on the Obamacare exchanges hostage until Democrats agree to fund his wall. If they continue to stonewall, then, when the ACA s insurance marketplace implodes or the government shuts down (or both), he ll blame Democrats and the whole country will, too.He s not seeing both sides, though. The Democrats actually hold all the good cards here.Why? Surely we can see how both sides have a decent hand, can t we? Trump s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, even said: We d offer them $1 of CSR payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. A one-for-one trade sounds nice and equitable, doesn t it? Trump gets his wall and we get continued stability in the health insurance market, and the government keeps operating. Here s what he s not seeing: Democrats aren t the only ones who don t want to waste money on a big wall along the southern border. Many Republicans don t, either, and that gives Democrats major leverage over Trump.Chuck Schumer s spokesman issued a statement that said: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.[I]f the administration would drop their 11th-hour demand for a wall that Democrats   and a good number of Republicans   oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Some in the GOP have privately said that it would help if the Trump White House would move on from the border wall because there are too many in Congress who don t want to fund it. Furthermore, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are busy working toward creating a more bipartisan spending bill. But they know that, with control of the entire federal government, they will own a healthcare disaster and they will own a shutdown no matter what Trump decides to say about it.Republicans want to avoid a shutdown   they ve long since figured out that the country blamed them for the 2013 shutdown. That means working with Democrats, including scrapping funding for the wall if doing so means Democrats will agree to other things.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recognizes that Democrats have all the leverage here, and that they need to use that leverage to their advantage. Republicans control both Congress and the White House   people are not going to blame Democrats for a shutdown or for destabilizing the insurance marketplace under these circumstances.Mulvaney actually thinks that Congress should get out of the way of Trump s agenda: This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules. The border wall is a non-starter and possibly dead, at least for now. There are more important things to think about than a wall that won t do anything that Trump claims it will.Featured image by Shawn Thew   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
" Hillary UNLOADS On Trump For Attacking Human Rights, Shows GOP Who SHOULD Have Been POTUS (VIDEO)","On Thursday, Hillary Clinton ripped Donald Trump and his bigoted administration apart for being on the wrong side of history and refusing to defend LGBT rights   and while she was at it, she showed conservatives just what they missed out on by letting a former reality television star get into the White House instead of a well-qualified politician.At a fundraiser for LGBT community organization The Center, Clinton received an award and gave a speech in which she thanked her audience for their continued support. However, her message came with a chilling warning about the Trump administration as she said the progress that we fought for, that many of you were on the front lines for. It may not be as secure as we once expected.  Clinton blasted Trump: We may not ever be able to count on this administration to lead on LGBT issues. Then, she couldn t resist rattling off several of the things Trump has been doing to directly attack and weaken the LGBT community. She said: When this administration rescinded protections for transgender students, my heart broke. When I learned about the proposed cuts in funding for HIV and AIDS research, I thought about all of our efforts to try and achieve an AIDS-free generation. Some of the changes that we re seeing should seem small, but they matter a great deal if you re the person affected. Others carry historic significance, like the future of the Supreme Court. While Clinton was not always a supporter of same-sex marriage, she had changed her tone several years ago and has been a powerful ally since. In her usual classy way, she called on Americans to stick together and unite to protect human rights and resist homophobia. Clinton said: I know the election hit a lot of us hard. I can tell you this: Even when it feels tempting to pull the covers over your heads, please keep going. Clinton s skilled and powerful delivery is something that Trump could only dream to emulate one day. Despite having lost the election to Trump, the majority of Americans still love and support Clinton, as Trump s approval rating plummets by the day. The support for her message shows that America no longer supports the values of the GOP any longer, and that conservatives have made a major mistake by putting Trump in the White House.You can watch Clinton s speech below: Featured image via Drew Angerer and Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Sarah Palin And Her White Trash Friends Get TORCHED For Disrespecting Hillary Clinton’s White House Portrait,"It s bad enough they were even allowed to step foot in the White House.But Sarah Palin, Kid Rock, and Ted Nugent also decided to stand in front of Hillary Clinton s portrait and completely disrespect it.When two gay activists raised their middle fingers toward Ronald Reagan s White House portrait a few years ago, conservatives threw a collective temper tantrum over it. They complained for days about the utter lack of respect shown toward Reagan. Of course, Reagan s inaction during the AIDS epidemic during his presidency understandably angers many people.However, two gay activists from Philadelphia is not the same as three people who are public figures. Nugent and Kid Rock are both musicians and Palin is a former vice-presidential candidate.As such, they are and should be held to a higher standard.Sarah Palin was invited to the White House by Donald Trump, who told her to bring some friends. For some reason, she chose Nugent, a man who shit his pants to avoid serving his country in Vietnam and later wrote an ode to pedophilia, and Robert Ritchie (Kid Rock), an alcoholic who has committed assault and battery and has a sex tape.Seriously, these people got to pal around in the Oval Office. It s disgraceful.But the trio did more than that. Instead of just acting like adults for the day, they decided to act like complete jackasses by mocking Hillary Clinton s White House portrait. Hillary Clinton has a White House portrait because she was the First Lady. And a classy First Lady at that, unlike Melania Trump, whom you can find nude photos of simply by running a search on Google.In the photo, Nugent holds his thumb out as if to say Clinton is  outta here  while Palin had a look of disgust on her face. Ritchie merely folded his arms across his chest in disdain.Here s the photo via Facebook:Of course, conservatives are cheering about this utter lack of disrespect even though they would have thrown a massive hissy fit had three liberal celebrities done the same to a portrait of a Republican First Lady.Most Americans, however, did not appreciate Palin and her friends  disrespect of a former First Lady.Again, Sarah Palin is a quitter and grifter who will never work in the White House. Ted Nugent is a racist who has a thing for underage girls. And Kid Rock is the poster boy for who the war on drugs should be waged against. Donald Trump degraded the White House by inviting these three losers to visit and he should be ashamed of himself for once again demonstrating why America is a laughingstock around the world.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Hawaii Attorney General HUMILIATES Jeff Sessions For Whining About Judge On ‘Island In The Pacific’,"Donald Trump s Attorney General just got schooled on the Constitution.Earlier this week, Jeff Sessions bitched about a judge  on an island in the Pacific  having the power to block an executive order. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,  Sessions said.Of course, Sessions is a hypocrite because he cheered on judges who blocked executive orders issued by President Obama.But because the order was issued by his rich white boss, Sessions is all of a sudden complaining.Judge Derrick Watson stood up to Trump and his racist administration a couple months ago by blocking parts of the immigration ban that barred Muslims from certain nations from entering the country. Trump s ban caused international chaos and violated the civil rights of thousands.Hawaii is not merely an  island in the Pacific,  however. It s also an official state under the same Constitution that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump violate on a daily basis.In the Constitution, the founding fathers created the Judicial Branch of our government to serve as a check on executive and legislative power. The judiciary has the power to review executive orders and laws and can block and strike them down if they are found to be unconstitutional.Judge Watson exercised his judicial power.Sessions  statement is a disgraceful attempt to undermine the judicial branch.Hawaii Attorney General Dougal Chin fired back at Sessions on Thursday by explaining how the Constitution works. President Trump previously called a federal judge in California a so-called judge. Now U.S. Attorney General Sessions appears to dismiss a federal judge in Hawaii as just a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific. Our Constitution created a separation of powers in the United States for a reason. Our federal courts, established under Article III of the Constitution, are co-equal partners with Congress and the President. It is disappointing Sessions does not acknowledge that. Indeed, America needs an Attorney General who actually understands the Constitution, and Sessions clearly does not.One of Sessions  Justice Department lackeys even tried to pathetically clarify the offensive remarks. Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific a beautiful one where the Attorney General s granddaughter was born. The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. Wrong. If Trump and his administration think the ruling is flawed then they should seek opinions from higher courts. That s how the system works. The White House and Justice Department can t just ignore a court ruling because they disagree with it. Also, national security should not be used as an excuse to ignore the Constitution. That s a slippery slope to tyranny. If that excuse were acceptable Trump and Sessions would use it all the time to justify anything and everything they do.Jeff Sessions should be embarrassed for attacking the judicial branch the way he did and he definitely deserved the humiliation he has been receiving. Frankly, he should resign in disgrace.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Stephen Colbert SCORCHES Jeff Sessions’ Racism In One Brilliant Tweet,"Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots. Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  Muslim ban, Muslim ban. On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so. He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer. Shameful, but true.

 Trump Panics: Judging My First 100 Days In Office Is A ‘Ridiculous Standard’,"Alleged president Donald Trump doesn t want to be judged by his first 100 days in office even though it became a tradition after Franklin D. Roosevelt s first few months after taking the oath. But really, we can t blame the former reality show star for wanting to forgo the tradition considering how horrifying Trump s nearly 100 days in office has been. As for his accomplishments, we re not seeing any. And in comparison to former President Barack Obama, Trump looks like an amateur.Early this morning Trump tweeted,  No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017We re not sure what Trump did in South Carolina. Perhaps he s referring to Georgia where Democrat Jon Ossoff outperformed every Republican candidate in the deep red district but he just didn t pay the 50 percent mark to avoid a runoff. Or maybe Trump is talking about Neil Gorsuch. It s hard to tell.Trump s 100th day may begin with a government shutdown if Congress fails to approve a new spending deal.Obama passed 11 laws during his first 100 days in office. So far, Trump has focused on reversing vital things that his predecessor has done for this country, including Internet privacy and health care, among others. The bigot-in-chief failed twice to pass a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Trump is inundated with scandals, including his administration s possible collusion with a hostile foreign government to interfere in our election process.The Internet reacted to Trump s tweet:Trump says the first 100 days is a ""ridiculous standard""Signed legislation compared.

 Trump HUMILIATED Over Name-Drop That’s Worse Than Frederick Douglass Gaffe (TWEETS),"Is The Donald really this oblivious to the entire world? And history? And, well, everything? Two and a half months after embarrassing himself by implying that Frederick Douglass was still alive, he embarrasses himself by dropping the name of yet another famous person who has passed away   Luciano Pavarotti. He didn t just imply that Pavarotti is still living today (he died of pancreatic cancer ten years ago). While he and Italy s prime minister held a joint press conference, he must have decided to praise Italy for the gift of Pavarotti (or rather, he decided to use Pavarotti to puff himself up and appear more superior) by saying: Pavarotti, friend of mine, great friend of mine. First off, as stated before, Pavarotti is no longer gracing the world with his amazing tenor voice. Twitter made a point of reminding Trump of that:@kylegriffin1 @colattesipper @MSNBC Which is when I wish that Trump had died, instead of Pavarotti.

Suzanne Munshower (@expatina) April 20, 2017@IMPL0RABLE @teka21bat Trump s presser with Italian PM is so cringe worthy, his good friend Pavarotti can t even stand to watch it.  (((Shelley Rivlin))) (@srivlin) April 20, 2017But it s also not likely that Pavarotti was any friend of Trump s at all. Trump repeatedly used a recording of him singing Puccini s  Nessun Dorma  during his campaign, and his family asked Trump to stop.  Nessun Dorma  means  None Shall Sleep,  and Pavarotti s rendition has a climax where he sings  Vincero  three times, which means  I will win. We all know how Trump likes to  win. The family issued a statement that said: As members of his immediate family, we would like to recall that the values of brotherhood and solidarity which Luciano Pavarotti expressed throughout the course of his artistic career are entirely incompatible with the world view offered by the candidate Donald Trump. Trump may well have met Pavarotti at some point, but one would think that, if they had been great friends, he would have at least been able to act like he knew Pavarotti was gone. The family may also have taken that into account regarding the use of Pavarotti s aria at rallies if it were true.So not only did he again demonstrate that he doesn t know a damn thing about anything that goes on, and he likely lied about being great friends with that man. Pavarotti was a great man. Trump is an insecure, pathetic fraction of a man.Watch below:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
" WATCH: Trump Directs Childish Tantrum At Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau Shows Him How An Adult Acts","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just demonstrated that he s the adult in the room when it comes to dealing with Donald Trump.In remarks from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump launched a childish attack on our northern neighbor and longtime ally over the dairy industry in yet another overall assault on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I want to end and add by saying that Canada   what they ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace,  Trump began.  It s a disgrace. I spent time with some of the farmers in Wisconsin   and as you know, rules, regulations, different things, have changed; and our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State are being put out of business   our dairy farmers. The fact is, NAFTA   whether it s Mexico or Canada   is a disaster for our country. It s a disaster. It s a trading disaster,  Trump continued.  We can t let Canada or anybody else take advantage, and do what they do to our workers and to our farmers. We re going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly this is another NAFTA disaster, and we re not going to let it continue onward. Here s the video via YouTube:Trump s tantrum drew a sharp but very adult response from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who told Bloomberg that he  understands  that governors in the border states are playing politics with the dairy issue, but then he pointed out that America  has a $400 million dairy surplus with Canada. In other words, the supply of milk in the United States has surpassed demand, which means farmers can t sell any more because there is already too much milk on the market. So it s not Canada that is the challenge here,  Trudeau continued, adding that we need to base our trading relationships on the facts so that people in both countries can succeed.Trudeau further pointed out that the United States subsidizes much of the agriculture industry and that we should  not pretend we re in a global free market when it comes to agriculture. Every country protects, for good reason, its agricultural industries. Trudeau went on to say that Canada is not going to  overreact,  but will instead  lay out the facts  and hold substantive talks about how Canada, Mexico, and the United States can fix some of the issues with NAFTA that need tweaking. Trudeau even addressed Trump directly by stating that once Trump is presented the facts he ll  take a different position. He has shown if he says one thing and actually hears good counter arguments or good reasons why he should shift his position, he will take a different position if it s a better one, if the arguments win him over,  Trudeau said.Here s the video via YouTube:Once again, Trump embarrasses himself and the United States.

" GOP FURIOUS As Repeal FAILS, Americans Now Prefer Obamacare Over Entire Republican Party (IMAGE)","Not too long ago, the Republican Party and Donald Trump made a disgusting move to screw over millions of Americans when they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with the American Health Care Act (Trumpcare). The plan fortunately didn t work out and was shot down immediately, leaving the GOP stunned and upset that their disastrous bill didn t pass. They ve just been delivered another devastating blow, this time by Americans who are showing the Republican Party they haven t forgotten.Thanks to the GOP s unethical Obamacare replacement, Obamacare is now more popular than ever   more popular than the Republican Party as a whole!Ezra Klein tweeted this amazing graph to illustrate:This is going to tear Trump and the GOP apart, considering how desperate they were to get rid of Obamacare. The overwhelming support that the Affordable Care Act is receiving now will surely make it harder for Republicans to get rid of it in the future, if they dare try again.This serves as a major warning to the GOP   if they keep trying to get rid of Obama s legacy and policies that clearly work, their party will lose all support and soon there will be no Republican Party. If conservatives thought they would have Americans standing behind them during their attempt to repeal a health care law that provides access to more Americans than ever, they ve just learned that they were very, VERY wrong.The GOP has no idea how badly the party has been damaged under Trump. He is completely obsessed with pushing legislation through, and it has been working against the Republican Party as each attempt of his fails and the party becomes more unpopular than ever. With the introduction of Trumpcare, Republicans have basically paved the way for Democrats to get Congress back in two years, and getting Trump out of the White House.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
" Chaffetz Says Screw Congress, Might Leave Before His Term Is Up (DETAILS)","House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), doesn t think he wants to be a Congressman anymore. He already dropped jaws when he announced that he would not be running for Congress again, but now he says he might not even finish out his term and may just run for the hills instead.Speaking to KSL News Radio s Doug Wright on Thursday, Chaffetz said he hasn t decided what he is going to do yet, but he might choose not to finish out his term. He made it clear that he still hasn t made up his mind about what he will do and is taking into consideration what the state of Utah would have to do to replace him if he walks away from his seat. I will continue to weigh the options, but I might depart early,  Chaffetz told the radio host.On Wednesday, Chaffetz made the announcement that he would not be running for either the House or Senate in 2018. However, at no point has he tried to rule out the possibility of a future run for another office, such as governor of Utah, for example.At this point, his office has not returned requests for comment or released an official statement. Chaffetz is currently serving his fifth term. If he chooses to remain in Congress, he would be able to serve as House Oversight Committee Chairman until 2020 according to the House GOP s present rules, which limit committee chairs to three terms.Chaffetz said he is considering abandoning his career in Congress because he wants to spend more time with his family and is ready to return to the private sector. If he does decide to leave, the race to fill his seat as chairman of the Oversight Committee will commence. So far, no one on the powerful committee has been willing to publicly confirm whether they would be interested in taking his place as chairman.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
 AG Sessions Directs Disgusting Insult At Hawaii After Hawaiian Judge Blocks Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions is as furious as Trump is over the blocking of an executive order that would have denied Muslims entry into the United States. Rather than reassess their own morality, the Islamophobic tag team has gone after the judges who have pointed out their plans are unconstitutional. For Trump, a former reality tv star and current 70-year-old Fox News viewer, the inability to understand the basics of America s justice system is pretty much a given, but his Attorney General seems just as clueless   and it s literally his job to understand the law.Highlighting his sheer incompetence to perform the job he was handpicked to do, Sessions (formerly an Alabama senator best known for being a racist) slammed the state of Hawaii and discounted its importance in the United States with a shocking rant during an interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin: We ve got cases moving in the very, very liberal Ninth Circuit, who, they ve been hostile to the order,  Sessions said.  We won a case in Virginia recently that was a nicely-written order that just demolished, I thought, all the arguments that some of the other people have been making. We are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. That judge  sitting on an island in the Pacific  Sessions was so quick to dismiss? He s a federal judge working in a federal court in the U.S. state of Hawaii. Hardly a random nobody.As ever, the Trump administration s go-to defense of their badly botched policies is to attack the critics for not letting them do whatever they want. Trump s so-called  travel ban  would have overtly banned many Muslims from entering the United States based exclusively on their religion and ethnicity. The Constitution is pretty clear on that. The ruling was so straightforward that it was actually confirmed by several other federal judges before Trump announced that he was dropping his stab at it and starting over.And given Sessions  track record, it is a bit more odious that he would choose to go after the  island in the Pacific  populated by a diverse group of Americans. Racist dog whistles aren t supposed to be this loud.UPDATE: As reporters have pointed out, Sessions  smear on Judge Derrick Watson is even more obviously partisan because he actually voted for him.FYI Jeff Sessions voted to confirm Derrick Watson, the federal judge he's now attacking as ""a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific"". pic.twitter.com/kfeL4ZoKrP  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 20, 2017Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"

 Voters Prefer America’s Most Hated Airline Over Donald Trump,"The current occupant of the White House has finally accomplished something for his first 100 days in office; he s considered by American voters to be worse than the country s most hated airline. United just can t stay out of the news. In late March, a United Airlines agent at Denver International Airport stopped two teenage girls from boarding a flight because they wore leggings. Earlier this month a passenger was violently dragged from his seat and down the aisle because the flight was overbooked. That man, a doctor, had to go to the hospital after the incident. Also, earlier this month, a man on a United flight back from Mexico was falsely accused of trafficking his white daughter.Trump is even more unfavorable than United Airlines.A whopping 42 percent of those surveyed by Public Policy Polling (PPP) say they prefer United more than Trump. In contrast, 40 percent favor Trump.We re sure the former reality show star won t be touting these numbers on his Twitter timeline:Pollsters found generally negative attitudes toward United, with 47 percent viewing it unfavorably. Twenty-three percent see the airline favorably.PPP discovered Trump fares worse than United, with 52 percent of respondents considering him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably.In the survey, United was ranked as America s worst airline. The aforementioned 69-year-old doctor s attorney said his client suffered a concussion, broken nose and lost two teeth during the incident.Trump s poll numbers are abysmally low, even in other surveys. The most recent one done by Pew Research shows the alleged president still garnering historically low approval numbers for any president during his first 90 days on the job.To put this in perspective, at this same point in Barack Obama s presidency, four times as many Republicans approved of him as Democrats who approve of Trump now.There is a difference between United and Trump. United feigns to be a caring airline in its ads, then drags customers off their flights without consequence. Trump is treating people exactly as he said he would. Nothing he does comes as a surprise to any of us. That is, unless you weren t paying attention during his campaign.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
 Exxon Mobil Brazenly Attempts To Use Administration To Grant Russian Favors,"During Watergate, the line became  follow the money.  In the Trump, Russia scandal, you can bet that investigators are following the money. In fact, the for-profit scheme is so brazen that the Trump administration, which is packed with oligarchs, is flaunting it.Not only is the Trump administration blatantly profiting off of the office of the presidency, but Exxon Mobil, the company that used to have Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at its helm, is asking for a waiver so they can profit in Russia.This is beginning to sound a bit like deja vu; a Trump meets with a foreign leader and mysteriously, new business ventures open for Trumpsters.Of course, it s one thing is that country is actually a trading partner   then only the Emoluments Clause is brought into question   but when members of the Trump administration attempt to do business with Russia, a country with whom our relationship can best be defined as  it s complicated,  (we have sanctions againt them) more than a few eyebrows are raised. They aren t even pretending anymore. Exxon wants to drill in Russia and you can be sure that if it were just up to the Trump administration, they would be granted their application, despite the fact that they were denied just two years ago.Exxon has been seeking U.S. permission to drill with Rosneft in several areas banned by sanctions and renewed a push for approval in March, shortly after its most recent chief executive, Rex Tillerson, became secretary of state on Feb. 1, according to one of these people. The company originally applied for a waiver to gain access to the Black Sea in July 2015 but its application wasn t approved, the person said.Source: Wall Street JournalWhile Tillerson has recused himself for two years on anything regarding his old company, the people who work for him in the State Department will be processing the application.The only thing standing in the way of the application is our very corporate friendly Republican Congress, although, at a time when they are investigating Russian ties, granting permission might not be the best way to win over voters. They are investigating connections between Trump s administration and Russia. It certainly doesn t look good that right after Trump snatches Tillerson from Exxon Mobil, they ask for favors from the government. Did I mention that Tillerson has what the Wall Street Journal describes as a  close working relationship  with Russia s President Vladimir Putin?The best response to the request did come from one Republican, though.

 New Research Shows Trump’s Border Wall Will Be Even MORE Worthless Than We Thought (DETAILS)," Build the wall! Build the wall!  Supposedly nobody builds better walls than Donald Trump, and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border. Now, a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever.Illegal immigration has been falling since 2007, but this latest bit of research out of the University of California, San Diego, says it will continue to fall. It s partly because of Obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say, Obama did not favor or enable an open border. He made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration. The right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here.However, the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard-line, xenophobic White House. Economic trends, such as falling demand for low-skilled workers, play a huge role too. That s a long-term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon.There s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early 1960s. However, in Latin America, it fell off far more gradually, resulting in a much larger number of younger Latin American workers who could find better opportunities here, in the 1990s and early 2000s, than in their home countries.That also is no longer true. The birth rate in Latin America is now about the same as ours, resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity. Furthermore, the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging. Over the next few decades, they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket, or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries.If you combine these factors, the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop. In fact, the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next 20 years even without a wall.And yet, here s Trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall, which will cost anywhere from $21 billion to $70 billion and take years to build, is absolutely necessary to securing the border. But nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost.Yet they re asking for $2.6 billion for just 71 miles of new barriers for FY2018. That s a lot of money for less than 100 miles of barrier.We already knew that we, the taxpayers, were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work. But now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective, but is wholly unnecessary.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
 Patriots White House Group Photo Sure To Infuriate Trump After Obama Comparison Surfaces,"It s no secret that Donald Trump has deep insecurities about his job performance compared to his predecessor. Making matters worse, Trump s favorability continues to take a nosedive while former president Barack Obama is seeing a post-office surge. America got its first example of just how thin-skinned and vain Trump really would be as president when he repeatedly lied (and had his staff lie) about the size of his inauguration crowd.We re about to get a second glimpse.On Wednesday, Trump hosted the New England Patriots football team at the White House in honor of the Super Bowl win. However, not everyone made the trip. Months ago, players started announcing that they would boycott the trip due to Trump s divisive rhetoric. His history of racism, sexism, xenophobia and intolerance were enough to make many players not want to lend their support to his presidency.In an additional blow, Trump s idol Tom Brady decided (last minute) that he would not be attending the ceremony either. Brady s official excuse was  family  reasons. It s unclear if there was another, more Trump-related reason. The news was probably devastating to Trump, who has long considered Brady one of his few friends.As a result of the boycotts, Trump s group photo with the Patriots was noticeably sparse. It looked even worse when the New York Times dug up the 2015 Patriots White House visit.

" BREAKING: It’s Real, Russia Stole Our Election And Now Officials Have Definitive PROOF","While we don t yet have the smoking gun that specifically says Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win the presidency, US officials now have the blueprint that the Russians used to ensure that Hillary Clinton lost the election, and much of it will sound very familiar.According to three current and four former US officials, a Russian think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin used tried and true KGB tactics to make sure the election went exactly as they wanted.They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.Source: ReutersThe first of the two documents was written in June. It didn t specifically mention Donald Trump, but it did outline a plan of using social media to sour voters toward any candidate who would share President Obama s hardline stance toward Russia.The second document was from October, just a month before the election:A second institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system s legitimacy and damage Clinton s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.In other words, all the anti-Hillary, anti-DNC crap you heard during the election was straight out of Putin s playbook. From the right, while Trump was making accusations of voter fraud, you can be sure that his marching orders were coming from the Kremlin.The US officials are still remaining anonymous and American intelligence agencies are not commenting right now, but it s clear without Russia s campaign of fake news and their attempt to undermine confidence in our electoral system was exactly what Trump needed to win. The hacking wasn t part of the blueprint, but that was icing on the cake that came from another Kremlin source.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"April 19, 2017"
" Trump Takes Credit For Republican ‘Win’ In Georgia, And Gets Brutally Humiliated With Math","You would think that a businessman would understand math. Not Donald Trump.Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in Georgia on Tuesday.As Republicans poured money into the race, Ossoff s anti-Trump campaign soared and nearly cruised to an easy win in a district that is considered a Republican fortress.In other words, Ossoff should not have been able to even get close to winning. But Donald Trump s increasing unpopularity combined with his incompetence gave Democrats a strategy to become competitive in even the most conservative areas.After being upset in Delaware and nearly losing in Kansas, Republicans had much to be worried about on Tuesday as election results flowed in.Even Trump recognized that the race in Georgia represents a backlash against his administration and Republican power in Congress, which is why he attacked Ossoff repeatedly on Twitter.It s a test of what Republicans could expect in 2018 when the midterm election rolls around.Instead of a Republican wave, however, the current party that controls Congress could be swept out of power by a Democratic wave, paving the way for Trump s impeachment and the reversal of the destructive policies he and his Republican friends in Congress have put in place so far.In the end, Ossoff did not secure the 50 percent of the vote needed to win. The election now heads to a runoff in June between Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.But that didn t stop Trump from declaring that race a victory for Republicans and taking credit for it.Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG  R  win with runoff in Georgia.

 Trump UNRAVELS As Republicans Admit He Should Spend Less Time Playing Golf (DETAILS),"By now, pretty much all of America can agree that Donald Trump needs to spend more time working and less time on the golf course   and it s not just the Democrats who think this. Apparently, there is now a big push from the Republican Party to get Trump to spend less time at Mar-a-Lago.Republican Joni Ernst confessed that the GOP is having a hard time defending all the time Trump is spending away from his responsibilities at the White House. At an Iowa town hall, Ernst admitted that the GOP as a whole believes that Trump should drastically cut down on his costly getaways: I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, DC. That s what we have the White House for, we would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington, DC. I think it s smart that he does business in Washington DC, so I ve had those same concerns myself. Ernst then dropped this bombshell, signaling that many Republicans aren t happy with how Trump is performing: I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think that has been bothering not just me, but some other members of our caucus. So I think that is going to be a topic of discussion that we have when we get back to Washington. Ernst has criticized Trump before, previously stating that he  has a number of flaws.  While we can t expect that the GOP will lash out at Trump for taking far more golf trips than former President Barack Obama did, this is a step in the right direction. It seems the GOP is trying to reel Trump in and actually get him to perform his presidential duties. They probably won t succeed, but their attempts show that Trump s honeymoon period is coming to an end as he has nothing to show for his first 100 days in office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
 YOU’RE FIRED: Fox News Is Finally Kicking Trump Pal Bill O’Reilly To The Curb And It’s About Damn Time,"For decades, Bill O Reilly has poisoned the airwaves with his racism, sexism, and right-wing rhetoric on Fox News. Not anymore.The exodus of advertisers from his show on the conservative propaganda network finally tipped the scales against O Reilly. Years of sexually harassing his female colleagues, being a domestic abuser, and lying about being a war correspondent were apparently not enough to justify firing him earlier, but lost advertiser dollars struck the killing blow on O Reilly s pathetic career.New York Magazine reports:According to sources briefed on the discussions, network executives are preparing to announce O Reilly s departure before he returns from an Italian vacation on April 24. Now the big questions are how the exit will look and who will replace him.O Reilly went on  vacation  after the New York Times revealed that Fox News has spent $13 million settling sexual harassment lawsuits against O Reilly over the years.In response to the revelation, O Reilly played the victim. The worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel,  O Reilly said.But the fact that Fox News paid off O Reilly s many accusers rather than fight them in court makes it pretty clear that Fox knew they would not win.Once the New York Times story got out, companies who advertise on O Reilly s show began pulling their ads in droves. The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now,  Mercedes-Benz said in a statement.And that s pretty much the stance every other company has taken to explain why they are pulling their advertising.Of course, O Reilly had his defenders as well.Serial sexual predator Donald Trump, who admitted he grabs women by their genitals without their consent, defended him. I don t think Bill did anything wrong,  Trump said.  I think he s a person I know well   he is a good person. Trump s decision to weigh in didn t help O Reilly at all. A majority of women in this country fiercely oppose him, and Trump s past statements about women and his past treatment of women was just another example of a sexual predator defending a fellow sexual predator.Fox News is expected to publicly announce O Reilly s departure soon. But they won t say he was fired. They ll make up some bullshit about how this was a mutual decision and they ll say nothing but good things about O Reilly. O Reilly will likely whine and claim that he s the real victim.But the impact of O Reilly s firing will last for years. Conservatives love his show and he was a ratings winner for a network that has started to struggle.Megyn Kelly s departure from the network was a major blow. Losing O Reilly as well will be crushing. Ratings have already dipped and Fox News  audience is aging.Fox News and conservatives are going to miss O Reilly. The majority of the country, however, are going to say  good riddance.

 Sarah Palin Gets Annihilated On Twitter For Whining About Elizabeth Warren Using ‘Fight Like A Girl’ Line,"At least Elizabeth Warren isn t a quitter like Sarah Palin.After all, Sarah Palin could have remained in office as Governor of Alaska and continued to build a political career. Instead, Palin quit halfway through her term to pursue reality stardom and has become nothing more than a desperate grifter who relies on donations to her super PAC to maintain her lifestyle.That s not  fighting like a girl,  it s conning like a conman.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, however, is still fighting for women and the poor and middle class in Congress and could very well run for president in 2020. Warren has been fighting for the American people for years and has become a symbol of the women s movement.That s why Warren posed with the  Fearless Girl  statue on Tuesday and posted the image on Twitter with the caption,  Fight like a girl. Fight like a girl. pic.twitter.com/qGTn46jS9W  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 18, 2017And of course, Sarah Palin whined about it by crying to Breitbart.Palin claimed that she s a  legit fighter  for women and accused Warren of urging women to  claim victimization  when asked about her use of the phrase. I don t know. Coming from liberals who urge women to claim victimization,  Fight like a girl  just doesn t sound the same as when legit fighters for equality say it, mean it, live it, and will never give it up. Basically, Palin thinks fighting like a girl means never speaking up when you re being treated like shit.Women in this country have had to deal with rape culture, discrimination, and pay inequality for far too long, not to mention all the attacks on reproductive rights coming from right-wingers like Palin herself.How can one claim to  fight like a girl  when one doesn t even bother to fight for women rights to make their own choices about their own bodies?As usual, Palin is nothing more than a complete hypocrite who is bitching about a phrase she has never lived up to.Even Twitter users slammed Palin for attacking Warren.@SarahPalinUSA Sorry Sara but you didn t create the quote , you stole it and claimed it as yours #GovernorQuitter  Joey Mitchell (@JoeyM728) April 19, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Before you know it, she ll be hanging out in Alaska claiming that she can see Russia from her backyard.

 BREAKING: Benghazi-Obsessed GOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz Too Scared To Run For Re-election (DETAILS),"Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has been a thorn in the side of Democrats ever since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. He blamed her for many things that clearly were beyond her control, most notably the attacks on the compound in Benghazi, Libya, that wound up taking the lives of multiple America diplomats. After that attack, Chaffetz, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, spent more than two years and millions in taxpayer money to keep investigating Hillary   each time coming up empty because she did nothing wrong. He even said he had investigations lined up in the event that Hillary took the White House. Well, now that Trump is president and there are no more Clinton investigations to keep his base salivating, Chaffetz has announced that there will be no 2018 Congressional race for him.Chaffetz took to Facebook Wednesday morning to announce his decision, and, of course, he insists that it was not a politically motivated move: After long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018. For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives. I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector. Here is the embed of the full Facebook post:Despite what Chaffetz is saying regarding his reasons for not running again, it s likely a pack of lies. After all, he made it his mission to destroy Hillary Clinton, and made it clear that he would continue to try and get her on something, anything were she to be elected president. However, now that we have Trump as president instead of Hillary, Chaffetz is choosing to turn a blind eye to all of Trump s scandals. He refuses to look into Trump s conflicts of interest, is mum on the Russia investigation for the most part, and has nothing to say on Trump s lies and obvious character flaws and deficiencies. In short   as long as the president is a Republican, he can trample the law into pieces all he wants.This stance would have likely been problematic for Chaffetz in the 2018 Congressional race, to say the least. His state largely loathed Trump, and the alternative conservative candidate and #NeverTrump media star Evan McMullin got a good chunk of the vote. In short   Chaffetz would have been primaried, and would have likely suffered a crushing defeat there. Instead of risking that, he is choosing to bow out early, and use lame excuses to do so.All I can say is good riddance, you nasty little tool.

" Pence On Aircraft Carrier Lie: No, It Wasn’t Strategy, We’re Just Morons","The White House led people to believe that a U.S. aircraft carrier was on his way to the waters off the Korean peninsula in a show of military strength. White House press secretary said,  I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence,  he said, adding that it  gives the President options in the region.  However, none of that is true because the U.S. aircraft carrier was traveling in the opposite direction.According to vice-president Mike Pence, the claims of the location of the U.S. aircraft carrier supposedly on its way off the Korean peninsula were not made intentionally. Or in reality, he s saying the White House doesn t know how to communicate because it s so inept, or perhaps, Trump used this to bolster his alleged presidency so that his first 100 days in office won t appear to be a complete disaster.Politico reports:Earlier this month, White House and Pentagon officials announced that the USS Carl Vinson and its accompanying battle group had been deployed off the coast of the Korean peninsula, a response to a missile test launched by North Korea. But on Monday, Defense News reported that the Carl Vinson was nowhere near the Korean peninsula and had instead been photographed near Indonesia.After reports from major outlets saying that the Carl Vinson had not immediately turned north towards the Korean peninsula, government officials were left having to explain why the aircraft carrier had not been deployed as initially described.Pence was asked during an interview with CNN if the remarks from White House and Pentagon officials had been intentional and the vice-president said,  oh, I think not  then went on to say there was already a strong U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Japan and South Korea. Pence did not explain why government officials declared that the that the strike group was  steaming up toward the sea of Japan. Here is Sean Spicer saying exactly that on Monday:CNN interviewed Pence aboard the USS Ronald Reagan at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base in Tokyo Bay and addressed the crew saying that the U.S. would  work diligently  with allies to maintain and increase pressure on North Korea. The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready,  Pence said.  Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response. The word  effective  doesn t mean what Pence thinks it means.Just one week after the announcement that the carrier was off the Korean peninsula, an official Navy photo showed that the strike group was actually farther away from the claimed location than it had been at the time of the announcement.Photo by Aaron P.

 BREAKING: Explosive Russian Dossier Deemed Reliable Enough For FBI To Obtain FISA Warrant,"Remember that explosive Russian dossier from a few months that revealed Donald Trump s collusion with Moscow and affinity for pee pee parties? At the time, the document (supposedly written by a British spy) was considered too questionable to be believed. But now, it appears that at the dossier may be more legitimate than originally thought.CNN reported on Tuesday that the FBI deemed the Russian dossier reliable enough to obtain a FISA warrant against Trump aide, Carter Page. Sources added that FBI Director James Comey had also used the document  to bolster [the FBI s] investigation  during his testimony to Congress.According to CNN,  the dossier alleges that Page met senior Russian officials as an emissary of the Trump campaign, and discussed quid-pro-quo deals relating to sanctions, business opportunities and Russia s interference in the election. CNN REPORTING JUST NOW: FBI used dossier of alleged Russian ties to Trump s campaign as part of the justification to get FISA approval. /1  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017The FISA was to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign at the time. /2  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017Page s trip to Russia in July 2016 drew the FBI s attention and raised concerns of his contacts with suspected Russian operatives. /3  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017Page tells CNN he will sue Obama admin. officials for  civil rights violations.

" Fox Host LOSES IT, Expertly Rips Trump’s ‘Buy American’ Policy APART (VIDEO)","While most of America can see right through to the flaws of Donald Trump s policies, it s always a special moment when someone from Fox News recognizes it.Earlier today, Fox host Shep Smith tore Trump s latest executive order apart, noting that it could actually ruin America s economy instead of help it. Smith, who has been a vocal critic on Trump before, expertly pointed out that Trump s announcement of a  Buy American and Hire American  order will actually cause the cost of goods in America to skyrocket.Trump s new plan will review the H-1B visa program for foreign workers; a program that many massive companies use. Pointing out that the program serves a purpose, Smith explained: Tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, and others all hire thousands and thousand of using it. Even automakers, including Ford and GM, use this program to find engineers. Executives for those companies argue they can t always find enough American workers with the skills needed for the specific jobs. They also claim the program encourages students to stay in the United States after school. Then, Smith went after Trump by pointing out that even the POTUS himself doesn t buy or hire American when it comes to his own businesses: But the White House says the companies take advantage of those visas, that they bring in large numbers of foreign workers pay them less, and drive down wages. President Trump himself has gone back and forth over this program. And as for the president s push to  buy American,  opponents point out the obvious, that some of the president s own products were made from workers from about a dozen other companies. And besides  the price of everything at your Walmart and your local store and everywhere else goes way up for you. Smith is exactly right and brilliant for exposing Trump s own hypocrisy, and for explaining to conservatives that the man they elected is not going to help America like they thought he would.You can watch Smith take down Trump below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 BOMBSHELL: Trump Lied – His ‘Armada’ Was NOT Headed Toward North Korea At All,"Last week, Trump was bellowing up one side and down the other about a possible nuclear test that North Korea was set to conduct over the weekend. He claimed we might launch a pre-emptive strike against them, and that we had two ships in the region already From an NBC News story dated April 13: The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.  [emphasis mine]Turns out, that wasn t true.The  armada  Trump was speaking of was, at the time, headed the opposite way toward Australia, and had not been turned around. It wasn t until the Navy posted a photo of the Carl Vinson and its strike group in the sea between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra that the story came out. The photo was taken on Saturday, Apr. 15, a few days after we heard that the Carl Vinson had been diverted and was heading toward the Sea of Japan.Now it s headed that way and should arrive sometime next week. Two weeks after we told the world it was already heading there.So what happened?The White House says they were going off of what the Defense Department said. The Defense Department said there was a  glitch-ridden sequence of events,  including a premature announcement courtesy of the Pacific Command, and a false explanation from Defense Secretary James Mattis.All of that, they say, contributed to the false narrative that we had an armada speeding towards North Korea in a grandiose show of force.Really? That makes all the sense in the world.Truthfully, officials don t understand why the Defense Department didn t issue a correction on its timeline of events regarding the movements of those ships. With Spicer and others actually answering questions about it, and the extreme tension of the situation, one would think they d be as careful as possible about this.Instead, it sounds like the White House is putting all the blame for this clusterfuck onto the Pentagon, which is par for the course when they re either caught in a lie or something goes massively wrong.Of course, some Trumpkins will believe that Trump was deliberately misleading all of Asia (sending them into a panic), as well as Russia and us, to trick North Korea into trying something or to surprise them later on. No doubt someone will say that s brilliant.And anyone who does say that s brilliant (up to and including Trump himself, which isn t far-fetched at all) has no idea what the consequences of that kind of a bluff could be. Regardless, we caused a panic both here and among our allies that didn t need to happen, and risked a war over something very false.The Trump administration had better get its act together where hostile foreign powers are concerned.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Man Dies In Peace After Learning Trump Had Been ‘Impeached’,"A dying man had just one wish, and that was for Donald Trump to be impeached. Unfortunately, Michael Garland Elliott died before impeachment even began (if it will ever begin), but he died in peace on April 6th, after his family lied to him.Elliott was divorced, but his ex-wife was still his best friend.Teresa Elliot, the man s  ex-wife and best friend,  wanted to give him comfort in his final moments.  Upon hearing that, he took his final, gentle breath [and] his early work concluded,  the obituary in the Oregonian reads.Source: SalonHere is the full obituary: Michael Garland Elliott passed away peacefully, April 6, 2017, surrounded by people who loved him dearly and cared for him selflessly during the last months of his life. He was born in Charlottesville, Va., in either 1940 or 1941 (he honestly didn t know!), and attended Lane High School, where he shined on the basketball court. After college at University of Virginia, he moved to Long Beach, Calif., where, among other things, he joined a semi-pro basketball team that toured the country playing exhibition games, dressed as women. At such times Mike was called Skaggy Maggie and continued round-ball domination, albeit with a different uniform.Mike was a Porsche enthusiast, owning a dozen of them over the years, but nothing touched his heart like  the ancient game,  golf. He was a founding member of The Reserve and spent countless weekends doing what he loved most with like-minded friends. He was very passionate about the game. One time (that we know of) he was angered by an errant shot and threw his club into a tree. Eventually every club in his bag was in that tree. Mike s health had declined over the past decade, and when he was no longer able to golf he accepted it with grace and humor, and threw things at the TV instead. Mike was also the sharpest dresser in town, single-handedly keeping Nike s apparel wing in the black.Though Mike had no family remaining, he stayed close to the people he d worked with in the plastics industry, especially Danny Velansky and Sean O Brian, who was by his side at the end. Also present were Larry Smith, Judy Wiley, lovely neighbors Russ, Sandy and Garrett, and his devoted caregivers Alisha Alex, Sara Young and Leslie Kampmann, angels in human form. No patient ever, ever had more loving care.Mike ran out of family long ago and is survived by his ex-wife and best friend, Teresa Elliott. Though their marriage ran aground, their friendship only grew stronger and hers was the last voice Mike heard. And the last thing she said to him was  Donald Trump has been impeached.  Upon hearing that he took his final, gentle breath, his earthly work concluded. Mike will be forever missed but never forgotten. There s a metaphor here (we re talking to you, Calexit people). Elliott appears to know that strength is in numbers. The #resistance can win, but only if we remain strong.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images. ",News,"April 18, 2017"

 WATCH: Donald Trump Doesn’t Seem To Know Who The Leader Of North Korea Is,"During an interview on Fox  News,  alleged president Donald Trump referred to North Korea s current leader Kim Jong-un as  that gentleman  while never saying his name. This didn t happen just once, but twice. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking,  Trump told Fox News  Ainsley Earhardt.  I m not like other administrations where they say,  We re going to do this in four weeks.  It doesn t work that way. We ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace. Things even got weirder when Trump said,  You know, they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton s book, he said,  Oh, we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed, they ve all been outplayed by this gentleman. And we ll see what happens. But I just don t telegraph my moves. However, Kim Jong-un assumed control of the country following his father s death in 2011 so we re not sure how Bill Clinton was outplayed by the 33-year-old dictator.  This gentleman  Trump was referring to was Kim Jong-il. They are two different people. And for the record, we ve had peace since the Korean war, so those deals were successful in maintaining peace   unlike the posturing Trump is doing, which is escalating tension to a level that has never been seen before.As reporter Ana Marie Cox from MTV News pointed out in a tweet, Trump doesn t know who is in power in North Korea.Guys.

My biggest concern is that this is yet another erosion of government ethics standards in this White House,  said government ethics expert and law professor Kathleen Clark at the time.And now those concerns are being raised again.Supposedly, Ivanka won t be paid a salary. But it appears that Ivanka is being compensated in other ways.Not long after getting her own White House position, Ivanka joined her father at Mar-a-Lago to dine with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife.Ivanka even posted a picture of herself with Jinping at Mar-a-Lago on Twitter thanking him for visiting the United States.Thank you President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan for your visit to the United States ?? pic.twitter.com/VLvzyDMiiY  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 9, 2017But what Ivanka was apparently really thanking Jinping for was the trademarks China awarded to her company on the same day they had dinner together.According to The Boston Globe,On April 6, Ivanka Trump s company won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving it monopoly rights to sell Ivanka brand jewelry, bags and spa services in the world s second-largest economy. That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago.Clearly, Ivanka Trump and her dad are still using the White House to get lucrative business deals and now that Ivanka works directly in the White House, she ll have even more access to foreign leaders to benefit her business and fill her family s pockets.Ivanka previously joined her father in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the same time that a licensing agreement between her company and Sanei International was at stake.So Ivanka Trump can t pretend that she s involved in her dad s administration because she gives a damn about helping people and serving her country. She only cares about herself and has demonstrated repeatedly that she doesn t care about ethics as long as she s making money. This entire administration is corrupt to the core and it s time for Trump and his family to be kicked out of the White House before they sell America to the highest bidder to enrich themselves.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Trump Just Shamed Our Country Yet AGAIN With His Latest Diplomacy Disaster (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has made a fine art of p*ssing off other world leaders. Thanks to our fearless orange tweeter-in-chief, Colombia s government is now furious with us too.According to Colombia Reports, Donald Trump met with Former President Andres Pastrana (1998-2002) and former President Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010), an opposition leader, at Mar-a-Lago. Current Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who has not yet gotten to meet with Trump himself, is not impressed.Santos has spoken to Trump to express his concern that Uribe s lobbying in the U.S. is a major inconvenience for the government of Colombia. But the only response he has gotten from the White House is that Trump will take care of it personally. Vice-President Oscar Naranjo said Uribe and Pastrana have overstepped by pushing their own political interests rather than those defined by the official government. Presidents and their foreign ministers are those who really establish and maintain these relations  with foreign governments, Naranjo explained.Uribe and Pastrana have both made it abundantly clear that they are opposed to the peace process and they are kissing up to Trump because the U.S. is the only country that has not yet promised to offer financial aid.Colombia Reports writes:Only last week, senators of Uribe s hard-right Democratic Center party wrote a letter in which they asked the US to not financially support the peace process.On Sunday Uribe published a letter to US Congress on Twitter, warning that the efforts to end 52 years of political violence could lead to Colombia becoming an authoritarian communist state similar to Venezuela.Additionally, the former head of state claimed that the transitional justice court that could try him for a number of war crimes is being set up by communist sympathizers.Juan Carlos Pinzon, Colombia s ambassador in Washington, said that Uribe and Pastrana made their meeting with Trump sound much more important than it actually was. There was an encounter, not a meeting or a formal date,  Pinzon said.So, it seems we can now add Colombia to the list of countries that Trump has offended by being a moron without the slightest understanding of foreign policy.

 Trump Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch Gets HUMILIATED On First Day By Another Judge,"Welcome to the big leagues, kid.Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice only made it through Senate confirmation because Republicans changed the rules so they could complete their robbery of the seat from President Obama pick Merrick Garland.Neil Gorsuch now sits on the high court and his first day was Monday. And of course, just like Trump, he embarrassed himself from the get-go.Gorsuch s first case involved a Census Bureau worker who had been dismissed and filed a lawsuit over it.The former government employee s lawyers want the entire case to be allowed to move forward instead of only part of it being heard by the federal appeals courts. Rather than keep his mouth shut and learn, Gorsuch apparently decided to try to prove that he belonged there.And he didn t waste time. Gorsuch was argumentative and spent lots of time on wording. In other words, it looks like Gorsuch is going to be an asshole judge who is going to base every decision he makes on exact wording and his interpretation of those words. He s going to nitpick and decide cases on technicalities.But then Gorsuch decided to go even further by changing the decorum of the court. Channeling Trump, Gorsuch literally accused attorney Chris Landau of lying in open court.According to Bloomberg,Landau asked the court to let the man s entire suit go forward in a federal district court, rather than waiting for part of the case to be addressed first by a federal appeals court. When Landau said he wasn t asking the court to  break any new ground,  Gorsuch gave a pointed response. No, just to continue to make it up,  Gorsuch said.But Landau is correct. As Bloomberg points out, there is plenty of precedent of the Supreme Court allowing such lawsuits to move forward in their entirety. So Landau really isn t asking the high court to do anything different than it has before. He s asking them to uphold precedent, something Gorsuch clearly has no interest in doing regardless of what the law says.But Justice Elena Kagan was quick to put Gorsuch in his place and humiliated him in the process. This would be kind of a revolution,  she began.  I mean, to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case. The room laughed as everyone recognized a good Supreme Court burn.So just like Donald Trump, Gorsuch is an embarrassment.Frankly, not only should Trump be impeached, Gorsuch should be impeached as well. He doesn t belong in the position he currently holds. It s clear he has no respect for Supreme Court decorum and that he will make partisan decisions regardless of precedent and the law. And Republicans are the ones to blame for this. They chose Trump to be their leader and they forced Gorsuch upon the Supreme Court. It s up to Democrats to fix both of these embarrassments as soon as they take back control of Congress.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 BRUTAL New Poll Shows Stunning Drop In Trump’s Numbers In Six Key Areas; Trump HUMILIATED,"Trump is not keeping his promises. As far as his supporters were concerned, he started off okay, but over the last few weeks he s done a stunning array of flip-flops, and people apparently are not happy about it. In February, Gallup conducted a poll of people who believed Trump would keep his promises, and at that time, a majority of American (62 percent) believed he would. Now that has flip-flopped, and today, only 45 percent believe he ll keep his promises.So what all has he flipped on?And there s probably a lot more. In short, he s proven that he s not the open, honest, and trustworthy man he claimed to be on the campaign trail, and people are finally starting to wake up to that. Too little, too late, though, since he s already in office.But wait! There s more. Only 52 percent of Americans believe Trump is a strong and decisive leader, down from 59 percent in February. 46 percent believe he can bring about the changes we need here, down from 53 percent. 36 percent see him as honest and trustworthy, down from 42 percent. 42 percent believe he cares about their needs, down from 46 percent, and 41 percent believe he can effectively manage the government, down from 44 percent.In other words, fewer people trust Trump to pretty much do anything now than they did a mere two months ago. As Trump approaches his first 100-day mark, that s a humiliating picture.Featured image by Ron Sachs-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Neo-Nazi Sues Trump For Making Him Punch A Black Lady At A Rally (VIDEO),"Apparently, if you are unqualified enough for a job, you will develop mind control powers   at least, that s what neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach thinks.  During his campaign, Donald Trump regularly encouraged his supporters to beat up African-Americans in the crowd, even offering to pay their legal fees if they did as he told them to (a promise that, like most of his promises, has yet to manifest).In March Heimbach, leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Youth Network and a loyal Donald Trump soldier took it to heart when The Donald screamed  Get  em out of here  as African-American protesters attempted to inform him and his supporters that their lives have just as much value as white lives (and infinitely more value than those of the crackers who would vote for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, though protesters generally leave that detail out). Heimbach, wearing his MAGAMAGAMAGA hat, can be seen in a video captured at the time shoving and punching an African-American woman as Trump sicced his posse on her.Kashiya Nwanguma, the woman from the video and other protesters who were attacked recently filed suit against Heimbach, two other Trump supporters, and the Trump campaign   and Heimbach, who is representing himself, responded with a countersuit not against the women but against the man for whom he voted.Heimbach claims he acted  pursuant to the directives and requests of Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump for President  and that if he s found liable for damages,   any liability must be shifted to one or both of them. In other words, he knows he s fucked and hoping the  I was just following orders  defense works out for him even if he does have to throw Trump under the bus. Heimbach says he denies physically assaulting  protesters, adding that they  provoked a response  by attempting to  disrupt a free assembly and campaign event and to infringe rights of the defendants and other attendees to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to vote and other constitutional rights. One again, he can be seen on video attacking Nwanguma. Since he will almost assuredly be using Google a lot in preparing his defense, he should probably look up  perjury  while he is at it. Mr. Nazi adds that he acted, if at all, in self defense  as well as  in reasonable defense of others    even when he was shoving his victim from behind.Heimbach says that The Donald is a  world famous businessman  who relies on various professionals including attorneys and other professional advisors,  so he relied on Trump s reputation and expertise in doing the things alleged.  This accidental admission of fault will, of course, come back to bite him in his posterior.This filing comes alongside one filed by one of the other attackers, Alvin Bamberger, who also attacked Nwanguma. Bamberger says that he   had no prior intention to act as he did  and  would not have acted as he did without Trump and/or the Trump Campaign s specific urging and inspiration.  He  admits only that he touched a woman  and, like Mr. Nazi, denies that he assaulted that woman    video be damned!Speaking of video, you can watch it below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Two GOPers Left Looking Like Gooey Piles Of Stupid In Front Of Constituents At Town Hall (VIDEO),"Republicans who backed Donald Trump because he was the GOP nominee while knowing full well that he was incompetent now have to face the wrath of their constituents. The former reality show star is not draining the swamp; he s filling it to the brim with terrifying creatures. He s not the transparent president he promised he would be. He s up to his eyeballs in scandals, one of which involves a foreign hostile government interfering with our presidential election process. The alleged president is also refusing to release his tax returns. Mexico is not paying for the wall. We, the taxpayers, will foot the bill for his ego-wall.U.S. Rep. French Hill and Sen. Tom Cotton held a town hall and had to face an unwelcoming crowd. The two Republicans were left stammering while trying to find answers for Trump s actions.Hill and Cotton look like they have on matching outfits.

Arkansas constituents told Hill to do his job as he stood there with a look of frustration on his face. He mentioned  a steady source of leadership  then a constituent yelled out,  Trump can t do that! Both of these Republicans are complicit in the amateur president s crimes.

 Trump Just Called A Fledgling Dictator To Congratulate Him On Expanding His Powers,"It takes one to know one. Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
" This Congressman Has Literally Created BRUTAL ‘Illegitimacy Clock’ For Trump, And It’s Magnificent","If you thought no one in Washington D.C. was feeling the same way about Donald Trump as you are, think again. Several people within the halls of Congress think he s as illegitimate as you do.In fact, one Congressman, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) has gone so far as to create a  Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock  in honor of Trump.If you visit Lieu s Media Center portion of his official Congressional website, this is what you ll see:lieu.house.govHere s Lieu s statement regarding Trump s violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution: The second after Donald Trump took the oath of office, he violated the Constitution and continues to do so. The Framers wrote Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution to prevent foreign influence over our elected officials. It mandates that no person holding office  shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State.  While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive by virtue of his continued interest in the vast and global Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents. This is illegal.Trump can stop his illegal behavior by divesting his global business interests or putting them into blind trusts. He refuses to do so. Not only is he violating the law, he is explicitly putting his financial interests and those of his family above the interests of America. Trump is not making America First, he is making America Second.As a Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I will do everything I can to hold Trump accountable. My first action is the creation of a Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock that keeps track of the seconds, minutes, hours, and days that Trump is operating outside of the law. At some point, the Clock is going to catch up to Trump. For now, Trump appears to be taking the position of former President Richard Nixon that  when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.  How did that work out? What Trump is doing is illegal and action must be taken to stop it. Either he needs to cut all financial ties completely or he should be forced to resign or impeached and brought to justice as the crook that he so apparently seems to be.Good on Rep. Lieu for taking the first steps in holding Trump accountable. You can t do anything without calling him out on his illegal activity first. Well done.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
" Mike Pence Just Dropped A TERRIFYING Bombshell On North Korea, Threatens War (VIDEO)","On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea to do Trump s dirty work and deliver a message that should make every American extremely uncomfortable.In an interview with CNN s Dana Bash, Pence confirmed that the Trump administration was throwing diplomacy out the window and abandoning  the failed policy of strategic patience.  Pence said: We re going to abandon the failed policy of strategic patience. But we re going to redouble our efforts to bring diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on North Korea. Our hope is that we can resolve this issue peaceably. [Strategic patience] was the policy of the United States of America during prior administrations to practice what they called strategic patience, that was to hope to martial international support to bring an end to the nuclear ambitions and the ballistic missile program of North Korea. that clearly ahs failed and the advent of nuclear weapons testing and development of a nuclear program all confirms the fact that strategic patience has failed. When Bash asked Pence to clarify what he meant, Pence said: We re going to abandon the failed policy of strategic patience but we re going to redouble our efforts to bring diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on North Korea. Our hope is that we can resolve this situation peaceably. And I know the President was heartened by his discussions with President Xi (Jinping). We ve seen China begin to take some actions to bring pressure on North Korea but there needs to be more. Resolving this issue requires all relevant parties, especially parties that bear major responsibility and play a key role in this issue, to work in the same direction and make a joint effort. You can watch Pence deliver this message below:.@VP Pence warns North Korea not to test President Trump s resolve in exclusive CNN interview at the DMZ https://t.co/qb7kjI3sPK  New Day (@NewDay) April 17, 2017While Pence might have tried to soften his message while he was speaking to Bash, he said this to acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Monday, making more of a direct threat: Just in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan.North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region. Clearly, Trump wants to take more of a strong-arm approach and is using Pence to deliver this terrifying message. As North Korea has already launched a (failed) missile and Trump has proven himself to be trigger-happy when it comes to dropping bombs and his own missile attacks, this abandonment of diplomacy could very well mean war in the near future.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
 Trump Influence CRUMBLING As His Own Supporters Share SHOCKING Resentment For Him (DETAILS),"The majority of America saw this coming: Trump s supporters are finally becoming extremely disappointed in the failing performance of their president of choice.Thanks to a New York Times profile of Trump supporters in Pennsylvania, we now know that Trump voters recognize that they re not seeing any of the  winning  that Trump has promised them over and over. Things have gotten so bad, that the only people in Trump s corner are actually losing hope.Theresa Remington, a home-care worker with two children on active duty in the Marines, had hopes Trump would be good for the Veterans Administration and health care system   and has been severely disappointed. Remington said Trump was Just like any other damn president,  and now she s curious about what things would have been like if Sen.

It s seeing a house on fire and saying,  That house isn t on fire.  It is very clearly on fire. According to The Times, Trump supporters feel they have been blindsided and are wondering where Trump s grandiose promises have gone. Some have been completely turned off by Trump s erratic tweeting. Some are so upset with Trump that they feel more confident that Vice President Mike Pence would be a more capable POTUS.Bill Yokobosky IV, a train engineer, admitted: It s not what he s done, it s what he s trying to do. He hasn t succeeded, really. He s fighting himself and he s fighting Washington. They re just trying to get settled in there. The Times  report of the defeat Trump supporters are feeling is right in line with Trump s approval rating, which is now lower than ever before according to a recent Gallup poll.

 Trump Finally Found A Book He Can ‘Read’ And The Internet Can’t Stop Laughing At Him,"As we all know, Donald Trump does not like to read books. Hell, he really doesn t read anything at all unless it s something that strokes his ego. But he finally found the perfect book and he humiliated himself by telling the world about it.In a morning Twitter rant on Monday, Trump promoted a book that is literally filled with mostly blank pages.

 Melania Has To Remind Trump How To Do National Anthem In Most Pathetic Moment Of WH Easter (VIDEO),"Trump s hastily organized White House Easter Egg Roll went from bad to worse after he almost managed to botch the national anthem on camera.After avoiding the children s event on the White House lawn for several hours so he could finish watching Fox and Friends (yes, really), Trump revealed that he wasn t prepared to handle even the basic responsibilities he was given for the event. In contrast to former President Obama, Trump declined to read to the children, so Melania had to instead. For some time Trump lingered on a railed balcony, separated from the gathered families on the lawn.When it came time to do the National Anthem, Trump seemingly forgot that it is customary to place one s hand over one s heart. While a member of the military band sang, Melania and Barron noticed that the President of the United States was just standing casually with arms at his sides. Melania can be seen nudging Trump s arm, and he finally realizes his mistake.*national anthem begins*Melania & Barron place hands over heart*Melania nudges Trump to do the same**Trump raises hand* pic.twitter.com/X59uYNg7rW  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) April 17, 2017It s possible that Trump s heart wasn t in the event because he had already thrown a private egg roll the night before for dues-paying members of Mar-a-Lago.

 China And Russia Chase US Destroyer Away After Trump’s Navy Creeps Up On North Korea,"Trump s loyalty to Vladimir Putin is being tested like never before. On one hand The Donald really wants a war with North Korea. On the other, both Russia and China have told him to back the f*ck off   and the Associated Press reports that these warnings are becoming more forceful after Trump s Navy sent a Destroyer into the Korean Peninsula:China and Russia have dispatched intelligence-gathering vessels from their navies to chase the USS Carl Vinson nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which is heading toward waters near the Korean Peninsula, multiple sources of the Japanese government revealed to The Yomiuri Shimbun.It appears that both countries aim to probe the movements of the United States, which is showing a stance of not excluding military action against North Korea. The Self-Defense Forces are strengthening warning and surveillance activities in the waters and airspace around the area, according to the sources.China and Russia, which prioritize stability in the Korean Peninsula, showed concern over the tough U.S. stance, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying the issue should be resolved peacefully through political and diplomatic efforts.The dispatch of the intelligence-gathering vessels appears to be partly aimed at sending a warning signal to the United States.Recently, Donald Trump stopped calling China a  currency manipulator  after his companies were granted 38 lucrative trademarks in the country (including for an escort service). As for Russia, we all know what Putin s people did for The Donald.At this point, it is surprising that the United States has any allies left given how Trump has treated them, and countries like Russia and China with whom we enjoy a shaky relationship at best (especially when the former recently committed numerous acts of war against the U.S. during the election), and Trump is testing our bonds with every single friend and frenemy we have.As Trump pushes us toward war with North Korea, he fails to consider that both Russia and China are likely to step in if he goes all Rambo on the tiny island dictatorship.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 17, 2017"
 ‘Lunch Shaming’: Schools Punish Poor Kids Who Can’t Pay For Lunch With Appalling Humiliation (VIDEO),"As we all know, there are many children in America who cannot afford school lunch. Some of these kids are  lucky  (and I use the term loosely) to qualify for free or reduced price school lunches. Others are not. To qualify for these government-sanctioned programs, the children have to be from a family whose income is no more than 30% above the poverty line. That means that a family of four can make no more than $32,000 a year to qualify. Any adult living in America today understands that this is a very difficult   in fact, damn near impossible   amount of money to live on. So, this leads to many children around the country going through the lunch line at school with the inability to pay. However, the tactics used to solve this issue are downright appalling, and they are being deployed all over the nation.A practice referred to as  lunch shaming  is being used to humiliate poor children around the nation for their inability to pay for their lunches. Some kids are stamped in the lunch line with stamps that say things like,  I need lunch money.  Others are forced to clean tables in the cafeteria in front of other students. Still others even have their hot lunches thrown out for their inability to pay.All this serves to do is humiliate already struggling children for things that are far beyond their control. Further, in the cases where the lunches are thrown out, the kids are forced to go hungry. Even worse, some of these kids only get fed at school, so that means that they are literally starving when their one source of food is denied to them.This kind of thing has lifelong effects. Luckily, New Mexico has become the first state to try to put a stop to the practice of lunch shaming. They have introduced legislation that would outlaw the practice, and would make it illegal to engage in any conversations regarding a student s ability to pay for lunch at school with anyone but the student s parents or guardians.The entire nation needs to follow in New Mexico s footsteps. The fact that this sort of thing is happening in the United States of America at all is disgraceful. We should all be ashamed.Watch the video report on this practice below, via AJ+ on Twitter:Children are being shamed for not having lunch money across the U.S. pic.twitter.com/4uSyIJYIGI  AJ+ (@ajplus) April 17, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2017"
 Trump Asks Advice From The Swamp He Promised To Drain – Americans Are OUTRAGED At What They Said,"Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast. And it s why the business world needs strong regulation. Instead, Trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard to the harm they cause.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2017"
 WATCH: Army Vet WRECKS Trump – Here’s the REAL Reason He Gave Generals More Control Over Bombing,"Trump was supposed to be a non-interventionist, but, allegedly as soon as he saw videos of poisoned children on cable news (the same children he doesn t want coming here because other videos that were edited showed him that refugees were all big, burly, 20-something men and not mothers and children), he decided we had to intervene in Syria. And he attacked. Then he attacked Afghanistan with the biggest bomb we have.Then he was lauded for both moves, and also lauded for giving more control over this kind of thing to his generals. But Army vet Jason Kander, speaking on CNN s  State of the Union,  has hit the nail on the head for why Trump really gave that control to his generals: I believe he wants to take credit for good things when they happen, and blame generals when bad things happen. Kander also explained that there were only two acceptable answers to why Trump would make such a move: He s the commander-in-chief, and he also needs to defend the reasoning behind why a commander on the ground actually made the decision to bomb Afghanistan with the biggest one we ve got.Had the MOAB failed to do anything at all, Trump would definitely have blamed the general who actually authorized dropping it. Kander backed his position up by explaining how Trump blamed the generals who were in charge of the failed Yemen raid, where we lost Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. Instead of saying,  We lost him,  Trump said,  The generals lost him.  Kander also used Trump s own pseudo-explanation of whether he authorized the MOAB drop to back that truth bomb up: If you think back to when he was asked whether or not he approved the dropping of the MOAB in Afghanistan, his answer was something along the lines of, it started with  Uh,  and then it went from  Uh,  to  Everybody knew exactly what was going on,  which was, of course, the opposite of true. I mean, he was giving that answer because he didn t want people to know exactly whether he approved it or not. Trump won t take responsibility for failures, even military ones.Watch Kander savage Trump over it below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 16, 2017"
" White Supremacist Trump Ally Gets Punched While Screaming ‘Clinton Is A Rapist’, Cries Like A Baby (VIDEO)","On some level, it s gratifying that punching Nazis in the face has become a national sport more popular than baseball. On one hand, violence is almost always inexcusable. On the other, they re Nazis. Mike Cernovich, a Donald Trump ally who invented the popular right-wing lie that Hillary Clinton secretly runs a child prostitution operation out of a D.C. pizza shop s basement (the place doesn t even have a basement) showed up at a Tax Day anti-Trump rally and began screaming  Bill Clinton is a rapist  at the top of his lungs like a f*cking moron. Then things got weird(er).Cernovich posted a video in which he claims he was  assaulted by the crowd  who was swarming around him chanting mean things. Cernovich drew attention to himself by calling Bill Clinton a rapist, which of course invited a negative response. At this point, no one touched him but he screamed for police to help him. She s touching me,  Cernovich said before repeating  I m under assault  over and over and over and over. It s really kind of magical in a pathetic sort of way. Man takes the stage at anti-Trump rally, declaring,  Bill Clinton is a rapist!  Crowd rushes man. pic.twitter.com/rIo4gE4RF7  Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) April 15, 2017It s funnier from another point of view:While Cernovich was not attacked in this video, another shows someone walk up and deck him in a perfect example of  be careful what you wish for. .@Rambobiggs Violent leftist caught taking a shot at Cernovich at anti-Trump rally! pic.twitter.com/zxF0XxckuO  Mike Cernovich ?? (@Cernovich) April 15, 2017Cernovich was not injured. In fact, as one of the videos shows, his first concern was posting the video on social media so he could capitalize on this opportunity to play the victim: I was just assaulted, so we need to go live,  Cernovich says as he composes a tweet and runs away to whine to people who think #Pizzagate is a real thing.Recently, Donald Trump Jr. said that Cernovich should receive the Pulitzer for his false report that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice improperly monitored the Trump campaign.Enjoy the video.

 Donald Trump Says Being President Makes Him Immune To Lawsuits As Supporter Throws Him Under The Bus,"Apparently, Donald Trump wanted to be president because he seriously thinks being president makes him immune to lawsuits. As usual, he s wrong.During his campaign, Trump often urged his supporters to physically assault protesters. And at a rally in Kentucky in March 2016, Trump did exactly that and it caused a black woman to be assaulted as she was forced out of the venue. I was called a n****r and a c*nt and got kicked out,  University of Louisville student Shiya Nwanguma recounted.  They were pushing and shoving at me, cursing at me, yelling at me, called me every name in the book. They re disgusting and dangerous. In fact, the assault was caught on camera and revealed that Alvin Bamberger, Matthew Heimbach, and Joseph Pryor each contributed to the crime.Well, a lawsuit was filed against the men and Donald Trump himself.Of course, attorneys for Trump were quick to try to claim presidential immunity to wriggle out of being held liable for the actions of the three men.They argue that Trump  is immune from suit because he is president of the United States. But that s not true at all and the Supreme Court says so.Back during Bill Clinton s presidency, the high court ruled that a president can be sued for action taken outside of the presidency. And since Trump was not president in March 2016 when he ordered the crowd to  get  em out of here  he can and will face this lawsuit.U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled earlier this month that the evidence indicates that Trump is at least partially responsible for the actions of his supporters at rallies.And even Trump s own supporters are throwing him under the bus.Bamberger, who is a member of a veteran s association, claims his actions were provoked by Trump. Bamberger had no prior intention to act has he did,  his attorneys wrote.  Bamberger would not have acted as he did without Trump and/or Trump campaign s specific urging and inspiration. To the extent that Bamberger acted, he did so in response to   and inspired by   Trump and/or Trump campaign s urging to remove the protesters. Bamberge is literally arguing that if he is found liable in court, so should Trump. And that makes sense. After all, Trump egged his supporters on every time protesters attended his rallies. He even once offered to pay for their defense if they roughed up protesters. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of him, would you?  he said during a February rally.  Seriously, okay, just knock the hell. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees; I promise, I promise. From that point forward, violence against protesters by Trump supporters got even worse.So Trump will have to deal with more lawsuits. Because no one, not even the president, is above the law.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Betsy DeVos Gets Her A** Handed To Her By Joe Biden For Being Soft On College Campus Sexual Assault,"Joe Biden once again demonstrated why the American people love him so much.During her confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos was grilled by the Senate. Her lack of qualifications and opposition to public education made it clear that she should not be the Secretary of Education. But her family has bought politicians over the years so it s surprise that she had enough Republicans in her pocket to narrowly get confirmed.One of the big questions DeVos refused to answer was about sexual assault on college campuses. Under the Obama Administration, Title IX was interpreted to also mean that colleges must work to stop sexual assault on campus. When asked about this, Devos balked. Senator, I know that there s a lot of conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance   and if confirmed I would look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinion and understand the issues from the higher-ed institutions that are charged with resolving these and addressing them and I would look forward to working together to find some resolutions,  DeVos said.After being pressed to answer, DeVos replied,  It would be premature for me to do that today. After being confirmed, she finally answered the question by revoking the guidance set up by President Obama and declared on the Department of Education website,  This is an issue best solved at the state and local level. In other words, DeVos is perfectly happy to continue letting rape culture continue on college campuses. She won t lift a finger to help women.And that makes Joe Biden angry. It bothers me most if Secretary DeVos is going to really dumb down Title IX enforcement,  Biden told Teen Vogue.  The real message, the real frightening message you re going to send out is, our culture says it s OK. You know, the major reason why women drop out of college when they re a freshman is because of sexual assault. Not their grades, sexual assault. And so, it would be devastating. Biden went on to slam DeVos for enabling rapists and said parents should not have to worry about safety on college campuses.No father or mother should drop their kid off this late August, early September at their first day at college and drive away worried [if she is] going to be safe. Parents don t drive away saying, Is she going to do all right in school? Is she academically qualified? Will she show up for class? How well is she going to do? That s not the conversation going on. The conversation that s going on is, is she going to be safe? That is an obligation of the school, and Title IX is the vehicle, and when Secretary DeVos by her silence didn t affirm that rape and sexual assault are forms of sexual discrimination  God, if anything is sexual discrimination, it s rape and assault. And that s why schools have an obligation under Title IX to prevent this from happening.Indeed, parents should only have to worry about how well their daughters will do in school, not about if some asshole is going to violate their bodies.By ignoring sexual assault on college campuses, Betsy DeVos is part of the problem. And when young women are raped and the rapists get away with it, DeVos should be held responsible. She is in a position of power to do something about this and if she won t do it she should be dragged into court alongside the rapist.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Trump Celebrates Easter By Bitching About Protests Demanding His Tax Returns And Gets POUNDED For It,"Rather than just wish America a happy Easter and move on, Donald Trump spent Sunday morning whining about the Tax March protesters.Tax season gave Americans across the country the perfect opportunity to target Trump and his refusal to release his tax returns.During the campaign, Trump promised he would release his returns after the election but quickly rescinded that promise because it s clear his tax returns include many things he wants to hide, including his ties to Russia.So protests broke out over the weekend demanding that Trump finally release his taxes.His response was to complain about how he shouldn t have to release his taxes since he  won  the Electoral College. Of course, you won t hear Trump talk about the popular vote since he lost that by 3 million votes.I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017Trump then accused the protesters of being paid to organize against him.Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017Seriously, Trump will apparently say or do anything to ignore the fact that people really do hate him and want him impeached.His constant response to people protesting him is to brag about the election even though he colluded with the Russians to win.At this point, it s surprising that the American people haven t marched to the White House and dragged Trump kicking and screaming out of office.But instead, they mocked him repeatedly on Twitter.@realDonaldTrump Show them if it s no big deal  Mike Denison (@mikd33) April 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did you win the popular vote lololol  Mike Denison (@mikd33) April 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump If you ve got nothing to hide, release them.

 Melissa McCarthy Just Took On Sean Spicer’s ‘Hitler Moment’ And It’s F*cking Perfect (VIDEO),"In case you were unaware, Sean Spicer has spent much of the week attempting to justify his claim that Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad of a guy as everyone says because he drove people to concentration camps   sorry,  Holocaust centers    rather than just gas them in town like Assad does. We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II,  Spicer, apparently under the impression that Passover needed a little bit of Holocaust denial from the White House press secretary, said Tuesday.  You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,  Spicer later said in an attempt to  clarify  his remarks, forgetting about all those gas chambers in what he calls  Holocaust centers  (or, of course, the mobile execution vans). Spicer continued to apologize throughout the week, but for some inexplicable reason found himself unable to undo the damage he did when he decided that Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all.Spicer s Hitler week had all the makings of a perfect Saturday Night Live sketch, and Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint. Dressed as Spicer in his Easter Bunny costume (if you didn t know, he played the role of the egg-delivering Easter hero during the Bush years)McCarthy s Spicer admitted that he  finally made a mistake  with the Hitler gaffe.  Everybody was like  boo hoo, well what about the Holocaust centers?' Yeah, I know they re not really called  Holocaust centers    Duh, I know that. I m aware,   Spicer  added.  I clearly meant to say,  concentration clubs,  ok? Let it drop. It would be really great if the nitpickers could try and see the big picture and didn t focus on every little slur and lie I say,  Spicey said.  That d be nice. We won t ruin any more of it for you.

 WATCH: SNL BRUTALLY Mocks The Kushner/Bannon Feud In HILARIOUS Reality Show Spoof,"Saturday Night Live is back with new episodes, and this week s cold open did not disappoint. As the iconic show went live coast-to-coast for the first time in history, they went all in on the incompetence of The Donald s reality show  presidency.   Alec Baldwin returned as the reliably buffoonish Trump, and Jimmy Fallon played the notoriously silent son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kusher. To round off the spoof, the Grim Reaper returned as the newly diminished Steve Bannon. There was even a cameo by  Mike Pence,  played by Beck Bennett, where the show ruthlessly mocked reports that Pence actually calls his wife  mother. In the spoof, Baldwin s Trump is doing a reality-show style elimination round to finally end the Kushner vs. Bannon feud that has been irritating him and amusing the rest of us for weeks now. He starts out by saying that he is holding a photo of each adviser, and only one will get to stay.  Trump  praises  Kushner  for being photogenic, while telling  Bannon  that pictures of him make him want to puke. In the end, Kushner is chosen, and another Grim Reaper-like figure comes to take  Bannon  to hell. After that, SNL kicked off what is sure to be a successful  President Kushner  narrative, as they have  Trump  tell  Kushner  to sit at the president s desk in the Oval Office, while  Trump  himself returns to the child s desk to play with his toys, just as he did in previous episodes with  President Bannon. All in all, SNL outdid themselves with this one. There are no words to describe how funny this is.Watch below for the most hilarious few minutes of your evening:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Conservatives ADMIT They Incited Violence At Berkeley; Here’s Proof (SCREENSHOTS),"Of course, when there s violence in protests, we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around. However, the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist, racist, white supremacist alt-right. Such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the Berkeley protests. The problem is, the alt-right was all over Twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa,  or anti-fascists, whom they ve branded as terrorists.Ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them, one particular person on Twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt-righters what to carry to Berkeley and how to set it up. They seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons.Check out what one of the  leaders,  named General Deplorable, posted to Twitter:General Deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal, so they can carry them into  battle,  as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle. Here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well:And this is General Deplorable s Twitter profile pic and info, which actually contradict each other:Here s the thing: This crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks.  This is what they really are:This is what #BasedStick means: a flagpole that doubles as an insurrectionist s weapon. #Berkeleyprotests https://t.co/ZD2tGdqjk0  Marie Walshe (@lacanlune) April 16, 2017The Berkeley Police Department sees these as weapons. In fact, any stick pole, post, or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool (along with anything else that can be used as a weapon) are prohibited. To listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams, though, it s the anti-Trump protesters who started everything, and Berkeley PD is horrifically biased. Yet, look at what they confiscated:Here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today. https://t.co/3qx3smYwgk pic.twitter.com/A70VCxFYEu  Berkeley Police (@berkeleypolice) April 15, 2017The American flags belonged to the alt-right, and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists. Lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence. They re who every  real American  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals,  but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support.It s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that, either.13 people were arrested and of course, General Deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and Berkeley PD for being biased towards the anti-Trump side, because of course.But they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally.

Unfortunately, it never works out for him. And even worse, when he faces the inevitable mockery for his hamfisted attempts to appear tough, his first response is to hide.Twitter got to see a perfect example of this on Saturday, after Don Jr. thought he d take a dig at the  mainstream media  and walked right into a pretty hilarious self-own. Donald Trump Jr., hot off of tweeting that his critics were triggered,  got triggered himself after posting this tweet onto his social media account:I'm going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the #MSM.

 REPORT: Trump Still Seething Like A Child Because Bannon Gets More Attention Than He Does (DETAILS),"We all remember how, in February, TIME Magazine ran a cover with the face of Stephen K. Bannon, Trump s chief strategist, on it instead of the face of Trump himself. Of course, Trump s massive ego doesn t allow one iota of attention to go to anyone else, so this definitely got under his skin. However, that was a long time ago, and one would think that Trump is over that little irritation, right? Wrong. New reporting suggests that here we are in April, months after TIME ran the Bannon cover, and Trump is still irritated over it.The Hill reports that a New York Times cover says the following of how Trump feels about the Bannon cover, and his employees in general getting more attention than he does: Mr. Trump remains annoyed by a February cover of Time magazine labeling Mr. Bannon  The Great Manipulator,  telling one visitor this month,  That doesn t just happen    a favored Trump expression for anger at subordinates who tend to their interests ahead of his. It probably doesn t help that this particular issue of TIME definitely added fuel to the fire on the  President Bannon  meme, which suggests that it is really Steve Bannon who is pulling the strings in the West Wing, and that Trump is just a puppet. This may have been true at the time; however, Bannon s power and influence in the West Wing has been greatly diminished as of late. He may even be on his way out of the White House altogether. Here is the cover that has gotten under Trump s oh so thin skin:TIME s new cover: How Steve Bannon became the second most powerful man in the world https://t.co/EJpO6Qqg9K pic.twitter.com/BdpY4Hw9Xb  TIME (@TIME) February 2, 2017If Trump is indeed still seething about the Bannon cover and the  President Bannon  narrative, indeed this is good for the country, as petty as it is.

 Trump Just Asked For The Public’s Opinion. A Former Obama Official Had The PERFECT Response (IMAGE),"Donald Trump might want to stop creating public polls  it s never going to end well for him as he is the most hated POTUS in history.It s no secret that even before Trump stepped foot in the White House, the nation was mourning the loss of President Barack Obama, stunned and heartbroken that a truly great POTUS would be replaced by an incompetent reality television star.We re now several weeks into Trump s presidency and we still can t get over it. If the average American is upset about Trump being in the White House, you can only imagine what Obama s former officials feel, having worked closely with a truly great man and leader. Today, former Obama official Chris Lu gave us a look at some major resistance to the new president.Lu was Obama s top liaison to federal departments and agencies, and clearly showed that he was fiercely loyal to the former POTUS. Trump made the mistake of asking the public what agencies he should cut   and it went horribly wrong thanks to Lu. Lu answered the question   by proposing that Trump s White House be eliminated!Trump was looking for a way to make the Federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable to you    and we can all agree that our government would be far more effective without Trump and his corrupt administration. Here s Lu s hilarious response to Trump:Lu wrote: The President seems more interested in visiting his own properties instead of fulfilling his constitutional duties. But if he wants to stay in office, he should disclose his tax returns, eliminate all conflicts of interest, and disclose who is visiting the White House. That s something we all could agree on. We have all seen how miserably Trump fails whenever he tries to get something done   four years under this administration will be detrimental to the country.Featured image via Feng Li / Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Trump Has NEVER Looked So Incompetent; His China Adviser Was Literally Found On Amazon (DETAILS),"With every new detail revealing itself about Donald Trump s administration, the humiliation that America is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach. We have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start, and just when it seems it can get no worse, Trump sets a new precedent. The latest detail in Trump s White House will have Americans more disappointed than ever before.Apparently, the morons in the Trump administration are so incompetent and lazy, they aren t even able to choose top officials correctly. Vanity Fair just reported a VERY disturbing detail about Trump s China adviser, who was sought out by the POTUS  son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner chose this adviser not by interviewing experts, like a normal person   Kushner found Trump s China adviser by searching Amazon. Vanity Fair wrote:At one point during the campaign, when Trump wanted to speak more substantively about China, he gave Kushner a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research. Kushner simply went on Amazon, where he was struck by the title of one book, Death by China, co-authored by Peter Navarro. He cold-called Navarro, a well-known trade-deficit hawk, who agreed to join the team as an economic adviser. (When he joined, Navarro was in fact the campaign s only economic adviser.) Kushner operated in much the same way when it came to crafting Trump s tax plan calling up someone for help out of the blue. Given the initial absence of pros who could do the job properly, he also tried his hand at writing speeches. Responding to criticism from the boss ( Jared, this is terrible! ), Kushner said, according to a person familiar with the episode,  I m not a fucking speechwriter. I am a real-estate guy. The idiocy being displayed here is mind boggling. Kushner, who at least has the sense to admit that he s way out of his league and he s just  a real-estate guy , is the person Trump has put in charge of basically everything. The same man that s looking for advisers on Amazon.Let s not forget that this idiot is the man in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East. With this amount of incompetency in the White House, it will be a miracle if the United States can get through Trump s presidency without a major crisis, although we re already getting pretty close to one after Trump s attack on Syria and Afghanistan, and his inflammatory comments toward China and North Korea.If anyone thought that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were going to being the check and balance for Trump, this report certainly crushes that hope. Even the most level headed people in Trump s administration are dangerously ill-equipped.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Americans Tar And Feather King Donald For Demanding Gold Carriage For Trip To England,"America does not have a king. America is not a monarchy. But Donald Trump apparently thinks otherwise and the American people are NOT happy about it.When President Obama visited England for the first time, he declined the gold-plated carriage the Royal family offered for his use during the state visit, opting instead to ride in a motorcade. The motorcade was not only easier to provide security for, it was less expensive and demonstrated that Obama was truly a man of the people.Donald Trump, however, is demanding that the horse-drawn gold-plated carriage be rolled out for him and that a parade be organized down the Mall to Buckingham Palace in October.Of course, we all know that Trump is NOT a man of the people no matter how much he makes that claim. After all, we re talking about a man who continues to live in a gold-plated penthouse in Trump Tower.Trump literally thinks he s a f*cking king and he is demanding to be treated like one even though the Constitution makes it clear that such titles of nobility are not recognized in this country.The cost of security is going to be massive and it s the American taxpayers who are going to be picking up the tab.As news of Trump s ridiculous demand spread, Americans took to Twitter to virtually tar and feather him in the public square of social media.While enjoying the spoils of stealing an election, The Trump Royal Crime Family requests a gold-plated carriage ride with the Royal Family. https://t.co/uRSrPoULCD  UNITE & FIGHT (@stopthenutjob) April 15, 2017@kurteichenwald They should give Trump his ride on gold carriage   off a cliff.

 WTF: Trump Is ALREADY Paying Himself For His 2020 Campaign (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is already running for re-election, with a campaign fund set up and everything. And just as he did with his 2016 campaign, he s using the campaign to funnel money into his wallet via his businesses, because why patronize anybody else, and pay them all those campaign donations, when you can just pay yourself with them?Thus far, that amount totals $500,000. $274,000 alone has gone to Trump Tower. $58,000-plus has gone to the Trump International Golf Club in Florida, and nearly $14,000 has gone to Trump s Las Vegas hotel. The rest has gone to various other properties.Federal election law requires any candidate who uses their own business for campaign purposes to reimburse said business for the market value of the goods or services used. Generally, this winds up being a whole one to two percent of total campaign expenditures. As of June 2016, Trump s expenditures at his own properties was more than $6 million, or 10 percent of his total campaign expenditures.By the Nov. 8 election, that amount was over $14 million.That part of election law actually forms a loophole that Trump has no problem taking advantage of to the fullest extent he can.Obama stopped fundraising for awhile following his election in 2008. Trump never did. As soon as he was elected, he and the RNC began fundraising for 2020, and thus far, they ve raised more than $42 million together. Trump s refusal to divest himself from his businesses means some of that money could very easily be literally going into his wallet as we speak.Given that this is probably the least transparent administration in a long time, there s no way to trust that this is all Trump will funnel into his pockets. He s a master at exploiting loopholes in the law. His supporters will probably chant,  There s nothing illegal about this, so shut up,  but legal doesn t mean right or ethical.The fact that he s already busy funneling campaign donations to his own pockets just adds to the growing stack of items illustrating just how unethical he really is.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Trump Just Went Full Hypocrite On National Parks And He’s Getting TRASHED For It,"Donald Trump is a hypocrite and even conservative outdoor groups know it.America s greatest and most enduring treasure is its National Parks. Conservation of these lands started under Republican President Theodore Roosevelt and has continued to this day as every president has created new National Parks to preserve natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.But Donald Trump is on a mission to destroy everything that is good in this country and one of his targets are the very National Parks that millions of Americans visit every year.Trump s 2018 budget slashes funding for the Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service, by $2 billion and he has signed an executive order making it easier for mining and drilling to occur in and around the parks.In short, Trump doesn t want to give the National Park Service the money to protect the parks and he wants to let oil companies pollute them.Despite these facts, Trump had the gall to pretend that he loves our National Parks and that he wants to protect them.In a proclamation issued on Friday, Trump declared that protecting America s national parks is important to him and his administration. It is a priority of my Administration to protect these magnificent lands, and to ensure all Americans have access to our national parks, as well as to other National Park Service sites, throughout the next century It is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren. Again, Trump s budget would hurt our National Parks and mining and drilling would do lasting damage to lands that are supposed to remain pristine for future generations to come.In response to Trump s proclamation, conservation organizations trashed his hypocrisy. We re really surprised and disappointed to see the administration come after national parks this way,  senior manager for the National Park Conservation Association Nicholas Lund said.  With all that s going on in the world, drilling in our national parks should just not be a priority. Even the conservative-leaning Sierra Club had strong words for Trump. If he actually cared about protecting our parks, he would have never proposed a budget that slashes their funding to historically low levels at a time when investments are needed to maintain America s best idea,  executive director Michael Brune said.  Our parks and the people and economies they support need real commitments, not empty gestures. Indeed, our National Parks directly benefit the communities around them because of tourists, campers, hunters, photographers, and a multitude of people who desire to see America s natural wonders, the same natural wonders that their ancestors saw years earlier.That s what is at stake here. The National Parks belong to the people and they should be protected for all time, not exploited.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
" White Grievance Princess Tomi Lahren Whines About Getting ‘Fired,’ And I Could Watch It All Day (VIDEO)","Recently Tomi Lahren   a woman who literally built a career on hate at Glenn Beck s TheBlaze tried to make herself seem less horrible than she actually is during an appearance on The View and said that her  limited government  stance included being pro-choice. Unfortunately for Lahren, while she could get away with making racist comment after racist comment, the one thing conservatives will not tolerate is a woman speaking out about having rights to anything   especially her body.Some are rushing to Lahren s defense after Glenn Beck fired her for expressing the one viewpoint she has (assuming it s legitimate) that isn t completely horrifying, and she is taking that encouragement and running with it. Recently, Lahren filed a lawsuit against Beck alleging wrongful termination   and she stopped by ABC News to whine about how unfair it is that she got fired from her position as an extreme-right propagandist because she said something that was contrary to conservatives  core  values  (that word is used as loosely as possible). My job is my life. This is my life. Without that, I feel lost,  Lahren told ABC News   Nightline  on Friday.  When your outlet is taken away from you and you don t understand why and you re so disappointed and you re so blindsided, it hurts. I was getting ready to go in and do my show and I got a phone call saying that show was not on,  have been suspended for a week, perhaps longer ,  Lahren whined.  I was flabbergasted. Lahren s lawsuit, like her persona, is as fake as any randomly-selected promise from the mouth of Donald Trump. She has not been fired and instead remains under contract. Most importantly, she is still getting paid. It is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her,  TheBlaze told ABC in a statement. She will continue to be paid until her contract expires in September but feels that her  First Amendment rights  (the First Amendment only applies to government interference) were violated when Beck decided that he didn t want someone walking around talking like women are people.Nevertheless, Lahren complains that she had been  silenced  and  sidelined  just like all those minorities she hates. I don t sit down in my chair and deliver my  Final Thoughts,  I don t have a dressing room, so I m terminated, I m fired  the way I look at things, I m not doing what I was contracted to do, which was produce a television show, a political talk show,  Lahren sobbed. This is not about politics,  she says.  This is about someone who had an opposing viewpoint that has been silenced and sidelined and thrown away. But, of course, that s what you do with garbage   you throw it away (and, according to the lawsuit, stretch yellow  CAUTION  tape across the door of its dressing room). I m someone with a thick skin and I can stand up to about anybody,  the thin-skinned bully said.  But when somebody does that that s really hard for me to take in Loyalty is everything to me, and you can disagree with me, but to go out and try to humiliate me? Very, very disappointed. I m a human being at the end of the day and something has been stripped from me and that s my ability to work, that s my ability to have a voice,  Lahren told ABC without providing any of the much-needed evidence that she is, in reality, human.  That s been taken from me wrongfully. So I m upset by it, and I m hurt by it and I feel betrayed by it. Interestingly, her  pro-choice  comments don t exactly mix well with her numerous aspersions cast at women who correctly believe they have a right to make decisions regarding their own bodies.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Tomi On AbortionIt's over, folks.

" Trump Demands Queen Of Britain Pick Him Up In Gold-Plated Carriage, Organize Parade During Visit","Trump ran on  fiscal responsibility,  but has since made it clear that it doesn t apply to him.In yet another intentional embarrassment, details have leaked regarding Trump s demands for his upcoming state visit to England. They are petty and childish, and have infuriated much of England.Trump is said to have asked the Queen of England to pick him up in a gold-plated horse-drawn carriage and be given a parade as he makes his way to Buckingham Palace for an official visit.Donald Trump waving from the Queen s royal carriage is not a scenario many would have foreseen a year ago, but it has become a very real prospect, forcing security services to plan an unprecedented lockdown.The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.This may be another petty attempt by Trump to appear  better  than his predecessor, President Obama. The former president had repeatedly told the English government that it was not expected to drive him around in a gold chariot, citing cost and security.Trump, who views appearances as everything, has a different perspective. Who would have thought?Their living room Trump tower. Gold leaf walls-that's normal pic.twitter.com/uZqPKRXg4Q  Debra Kamin (@ubucky) July 30, 2016For the English government, Trump s request is said to be a financial, security and logistical nightmare. The Times again:One source said that Mr Trump s decision to opt for the carriage, rather than the bullet and bomb-proof car that was used by his predecessor presented a range of fresh headaches.The source said:  The vehicle which carries the president of the United States is a spectacular vehicle. It is designed to withstand a massive attack like a low-level rocket grenade. If he s in that vehicle he is incredibly well protected and on top of that it can travel at enormous speed. If he is in a golden coach being dragged up the Mall by a couple of horses, the risk factor is dramatically increased. The result is that London will go into lockdown mode not seen since the Olympics. The crushing financial burden will, of course, be footed by the English taxpayer. Trump, who makes his Secret Service detail rent their own golf courses when he plays golf at his own course, is not expected to chip in any money.Trump s expectations to be treated as nobility is a further insult to the British people, 1.8 million of whom recently signed a petition asking that Trump be banned from the country entirely. At several times, Parliament has debated whether to forbid Trump from entering England due to his history of racism and sexism. During the fiesty debate, two British PMs got into a heated exchange which culminated in this epic zinger:Carmichael:  Having offered a state visit [to Trump] this time, what will we offer the next time we want to get a favorable response? Salmond:  The crown jewels. Sadly, watching Trump prance around London in gold, the joke doesn t seem like much of a joke any longer.Featured image via Stefan Wermuth   WPA Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News,"A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"

" BREAKING: Trump Is Playing With Fire, And He Just Brought Us One Step Closer To Nuclear War","North Korea just made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of backing down from Trump, and that Trump, for all his dick-swinging, does not scare them. In fact, according to the U.K. s Mirror, North Korea just let loose with a blistering warning to Trump over his posturing: Our toughest counteraction against the US and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive.We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a US pre-emptive strike. Their vice foreign minister also added this: Whatever comes from the US, we will cope with it. We are fully prepared. The army and people will courageously counter those who encroach upon our dignity and sovereignty and will always mercilessly ravage all provocative options of the US. They ve also flat-out said,  We will go to war if they choose,  clearly putting the ball in our court as to whether or not war happens.Trump reportedly threatened to hit North Korea with Tomahawks the same missiles we launched into Syria to destroy absolutely nothing if they go ahead with a nuclear test this weekend. But that s not all   we also recently test-dropped an inert nuclear bomb to ensure that our military planes can carry and deliver it.There s a slim chance we could decide to use that on North Korea.It s not that North Korea isn t a problem. It s that this military show is having the opposite effect of what Trump no doubt thinks should be happening, despite North Korea being a very aggressive regime. And there will be collateral damage if we launch a pre-emptive strike at North Korea. They ll hit our bases in South Korea, but they may also retaliate directly against our allies in the region, including Japan.If it s nuclear war, well, the whole world will suffer.China is begging both us and North Korea to cool it. Russia has also asked both countries to be very careful. South Korea has warned us not to start anything on the peninsula without their consent as a military ally.

Now China is neither an ally or enemy of the United States , but they are a major power with around 300 nuclear warheads and the largest army in the world  a fact many of our allies would consider before backing us in any war that might involve them. Trump would, as well, if he had any interest in averting World War III. But, as Trump says,  I love war. We call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing, hoping to appeal to Trump s better nature and forgetting that he doesn t have one. If a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner,  Yi added on Friday during a joint press conference with his French counterpart. Lately, tensions have risen with the US and [South Korea] on one side, and [North Korea] on the other, and one has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment,  Yi said, adding that the side provoking the conflict (Trump in this case or, more correctly, the taxpayers he represents) must assume the historic responsibility and pay the corresponding price. As the world worries about what Trump will do to satisfy his massive ego   especially after dropping the  mother of all bombs  recently   he seems nonplussed, spending his weekend golfing instead of worrying about the crisis he has helped exacerbate.Will Trump risk a world war and a gigantic hit to the United States  treasury? I think we all know the answer to that:  as soon as he is done golfing. Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 14, 2017"
" Jake Tapper STUNNED By Trump’s Stupidity, SHREDS His Denial Of Global Warming (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump has an extremely hard time accepting, it s evidence and facts. It doesn t matter how much proven, scientifically backed data you put in front of the undeserving POTUS   his first impulse is to whine about how biased and dishonest the information is, even when it comes to something as serious and common sense as climate change.On Friday, CNN s Jake Tapper tore Trump a new one by making fun of his denial of what is happening to our environment. In a segment on Australia s Great Barrier Reef, Tapper mocked Trump for previously calling global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese. As Tapper spoke about coral bleaching and the effects that the rising temperatures have had on the Great Barrier Reef, Tapper stated that coral bleaching was  proof that climate change, at least partially man made, is destroying the planet,  noting that  once-colorful coral reefs off the coast of Australia are now being bleached white. Then Tapper made sure that no one forgot that the current President of the United States is an absolute moron. Perfectly explaining why Trump s climate change denial is devastating, Tapper said: This news comes at a time at a time President Trump has proposed cutting billions of dollars from programs to study and help combat the effects of climate change which in the past he s called a  Chinese hoax.  It is, of course, not a Chinese hoax. It s seriously depressing to know that the man in the White House has called climate change a hoax. At a time when we cannot trust our President to make decent decisions on behalf of our country (let alone the planet), we re lucky to have reporters like Tapper reminding us that denying facts has serious consequences.

 Democrats Just CRUSHED A Bunch Of Republicans In Illinois Because Of Backlash Against Trump,"The Democratic wave has commenced.In 2010, Republicans gloated about the Tea Party wave that gave them control of the House and have since been bragging about the conservative  wave  that gave them control of the Senate and the White House in 2016.But because of Donald Trump and his incompetence, Republicans are now staring at an oncoming Democratic wave that could sweep them out of power.Unlike the Republican wave, however, the Democratic wave has genuine grassroots support and it s looking more like a growing tsunami.In Illinois, Democrats demonstrated this firsthand by taking down a bunch of Republicans in local elections in places they had never won before.According to the Huffington Post,The city of Kankakee elected its first African-American, Democratic mayor. West Deerfield Township will be led entirely by Democrats for the first time. Elgin Township voted for  a complete changeover,  flipping to an all-Democratic board. Normal Township elected Democratic supervisors and trustees to run its board   the first time in more than 100 years that a single Democrat has held a seat. We had a pretty good day,  said Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairmen s Association.  We won in areas we normally would win, but we also won in areas Republicans never expected us to be competitive in. They were caught flat-footed. Republicans apparently thought their seats were safe and that they would be able to easily run over their opponents for victory. But that did not happen last week.Donald Trump has done such a horrible job since taking office that even people who voted for him are seeing the light and turning on him.Because as it turns out, Trump s policies are going to hurt conservatives more. His attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act would have stripped millions of Americans of their healthcare. Trump is also launching assaults on Social Security and Medicare, environmental protections, education, etc And it s only getting worse as Trump is now close to dragging America into more wars as more fighting breaks out in the Middle East and North Korea makes threats.Trump has repeatedly proven that he doesn t give a damn about the American people. He only cares about himself and Americans who never paid attention to politics before are waking up and getting involved.That brings us back to the wins by Illinois Democrats and the rising tide that could bury Republicans in 2018 if they don t reverse course fast.Democrats are literally running competitive races and winning in areas that are dominated by a conservative population.They should be striking fear in the hearts and minds of every Republican lawmaker across the country right now. Because if Democrats can win here, they can win anywhere and even Republicans in the most staunchly Republican stronghold are not safe.These may have been just some local elections but grassroots efforts are the tip of the spear.At the state level, Republicans have also been struggling to keep long-held seats. A Kansas special election almost turned into a win for Democrats if not for a last minute flood of cash into the race by the Republican Party.And Democrats in Georgia are running a winning anti-Trump campaign that could give them another seat in the House that had traditionally been held by the GOP.Republicans also got their asses handed to them in Delaware by a Democrat running a similar campaign.In short, Trump has poisoned the Republican Party and Republicans only have themselves to blame. They picked Trump to be their leader, and he is now the face of their party. Everything he does reflects on them and the American people are incredibly angry about what Trump has been doing to our nation over the last three months. He has made us a laughingstock around the world.However, Republicans won t be laughing when the 2018 Election rolls around. They ll be devastated. And so will Donald Trump, because a Democratic wave in 2018 means he s likely to be a failed one-term president.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"

While their protest doesn t physically include millions of people, you can bet that millions are supporting it as we are forced to watch Trump s administration withdraw funding from agencies like NASA s Earth Science program which was put in place to protect our planet from climate change, and don t forget that during Trump s presidential campaign, he vowed to do away with the Environmental Protection Agency, saying,  We re going to get rid of it in almost every form.

 Anti-Defamation League LITERALLY Schools Sean Spicer; Offers To Be His Tutor On Holocaust (LETTER),"After White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided he would say Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad as Syrian President Assad,  as well as claim that Hitler never gassed his people, many people were outraged, and justifiably so.Either Spicer is an absolute moron, or he truly doesn t believe the atrocities that were committed by Nazi Germany to their own people, primarily those who were Jewish, and the people of neighboring regions.Offering to basically be Spicer s tutor on the Holocaust because he is so clearly a moron, the Anti-Defamation League s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote the press secretary a letter.Here s the letter in full: Dear Mr. Spicer:This week Jews around the world have spent time with their families celebrating Passover, the feast of freedom. In the Passover liturgy, we read that in each generation there will be those who rise up to harm the Jewish people, much like Pharaoh in ancient times and Hitler in modern times. Understanding and being keenly aware of our history   to  never forget    is part of Passover and part of the Jewish experience.Unfortunately, when the first days of Passover ended and we turned on our phones and televisions yesterday evening, we learned about your comment that Hitler did not gas his own people. Your comparisons between Assad and Hitler were not only historically inaccurate but they also were inappropriate and offensive.While you have apologized, this week s incident as well as others (notably, the International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement omitting Jews and your vociferous defense of it), have exposed a serious gap in your knowledge of the Holocaust, its impact, and the lessons we can learn from it.For decades, ADL has been at the forefront of Holocaust education, providing trainings about the Nazi atrocities to a wide range of groups. We have conducted trainings for more than 130,000 law enforcement professionals and more than 35,447 educators, reaching more than 1,000,000 students. Our programs provide historical context for how the Holocaust was able to occur; teach the Holocaust as a human story; and create opportunities for critical thinking. Each of these educational programs focuses on the consequences of unchecked bigotry and hate.ADL would be happy to conduct one of these trainings at your convenience for you, your staff, and anyone at the White House who may need to learn more about the Holocaust. We know you are very busy, but we believe a few hours learning this history will help you understand where you went wrong and prevent you from making these mistakes in the future.Sincerely,Jonathan A. Greenblatt CEO Anti-Defamation League Hopefully, Spicer takes the ADL up on their offer and gets the education he so clearly needs. In addition, he still needs to be fired.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"
 Amazon Facing Mounting Pressure To Stop Funding Hate By Advertising On Breitbart (DETAILS),"A few years ago, very few people even knew what Breitbart.com was. It was a fringe website that only white supremacists and other bigots frequented, and the people who posted anonymously there almost certainly didn t voice their views publicly. All of that changed in 2015 when Donald Trump began running for president.Trump s campaign brought white supremacy mainstream, as he regularly retweeted neo-Nazis, refused to immediately disavow former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, and readily embraced the white supremacist  alt-right.  Breitbart itself went completely mainstream when Stephen K. Bannon, who ran the place, left its stewardship to become Trump s campaign CEO.Now that Breitbart and its toxic brand of hate is literally steps from the Oval Office, people who are opposed to its hateful ideology are putting pressure on major retailers to pull their advertising dollars from the right-wing hate site. The latest to receive such pressure is online retail giant Amazon.According to The Hill, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was asked by more than 500 of his employees via email to stop funding hate by advertising on Breitbart. In another exchange during a meeting, another high-ranking Amazon official, Jeff Blackburn, was asked point blank by an employee to kill the Breitbart advertising because the site  regularly publishes hateful and bigoted content.  One employee said the following of her experiences since people now know what Breitbart is: When people find out I work at Amazon, the first question they ask is - How can you justify working for Amazon when they advertise on a hate site?' Now, Amazon is being heckled from outside its own ranks as well.More than 500,000 signatures have been accumulated on a petition that demands Amazon stop investing in hate  via its Breitbart advertising.Perhaps the most effective effort will come from the social media activist group Sleeping Giant, which has successfully gotten more than 1,800 companies to cease and desist with the Breitbart advertising. Major companies that caved to the pressure include BMV, Nordstrom (the company that infamously yanked Ivanka s clothing line), and Kellogg.Keep the pressure on, folks. Boycotts and bad headlines work. Personally, I ll be using jet.com until Amazon gets its act together.Featured image via screen capture from Talk Android",News,"April 13, 2017"
" Here’s How Trump Is Going To F*CK Us Into WWIII, And It Doesn’t Actually Start In The Middle East","Has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war, including the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan, are just distractions from the growing Russia scandal? Considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the MOAB strike, it s not too far-fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.But the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan may not be all. Trump is threatening North Korea, too, in a more direct way than saying,  See my giant penis bomb? You shouldn t mess with me. We already sent a strike force across the Pacific to intimidate Kim Jong Un, who s been shooting missiles into the Sea of Japan lately. North Korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days, and the Trump administration has threatened to hit them with Tomahawks if they do so.But that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in North Korea as well:The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site.American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.Because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power. North Korea has warned that if we launch a pre-emptive strike against them, they could launch a nuke at us. Hot air? Maybe. But it would be better for Trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it.If dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them, then nothing will be. If we launch missiles at North Korea in a pre-emptive strike for a nuclear test, we ve committed an act of war, and no matter how we justify it, we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power.And North Korea may or may not retaliate directly against us. While they ve threatened to  hit the U.S. first,  with a nuke should we strike, they might decide to hit South Korea, or even Japan, in retaliation for such an attack. In fact, Japan is worried that North Korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way. Sarin gas is the gas that Assad used on his people last week.In other words, Trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand. He s a macho peacock strutting around trying to convince the world that he s a bad-ass with a giant penis military at his disposal. Our military is not a toy, and bombs are not a toy, and neither are signals of strength in the situations in which Trump is using them. He needs to go. He s the biggest threat to the world we ve seen in decades.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
 Democrats Demand Jared Kushner Be Stripped Of Security Clearance,"Donald Trump s son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, conveniently forgot to mention a slew of foreign contacts, including several meetings with high-profile Russian operatives, when he applied for his security clearance. Now, Democrats are demanding that Kushner s security clearance be revoked in light of his failure to disclose the meetings.Five House Democrats penned a letter to FBI Director James Comey and National Background Investigations Director Charles Phalen on Thursday, calling for Kushner to lose his security clearance. Mr. Kushner s lack of candor about meetings with Russian officials appears to be part of a larger pattern of dissembling and deception on Russian contacts from the Trump team, and we believe the public deserves the truth about what connection, if any, exists between these incidents,  they wrote.The letter was signed by Don Beyer of Virginia, Ted Lieu of California, Jerrold Nadler of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Peter Welch of Vermont. The Democrats said they were particularly concerned about an article in the New York Times that reported Kushner had  omitted dozens of contacts with foreign leaders.  They noted that this story did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. The lawmakers added a reminder that  falsifying or concealing information on a SF-86 questionnaire is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Given the severity of the allegations and still unanswered questions about this administration s recently uncovered covert dealings with Russian government and intelligence officials, we are requesting that Mr. Kushner s interim top-secret security clearance be suspended pending a review of Mr. Kushner s compliance with the laws and regulation governing security clearance. The Democrats are also calling on Kushner to make public all of the meetings he had during the time of Trump s transition.According to Kushner s aides, he has been under an  interim  security clearance so far while the FBI has been gathering information on him. Kushner is also set to face an interview with Senate Intelligence Committee regarding his contacts with Russia.Via screen shotFeatured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
" This Guy Predicted Trump’s Win, And What He Has To Say Now Should TERRIFY Republicans","The media, and to a certain extent, the pollsters, got it seriously wrong when they predicted an easy win for Hillary Clinton in last year s election. Okay, technically it was, but our Electoral College said otherwise. One professor, though, warned the United States that Trump was going to win. Now, that same professor is predicting that Trump will be impeached.Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, reached meme-status last fall for predicting long before anyone else that Trump would win, using a formula based on the popularity of the party in control of the White House that accurately predicted the eight previous presidential elections. Now Lichtman wants everyone to pay attention to the rest of what came through his crystal ball   that Trump will now be impeached.Source: PoliticoTrump, naturally, loved Lichtman s initial prediction. #45 Elect even sent him a note. Taking time out of preparing to become the world s most powerful leader, he wrote me a personal note, saying  Professor   Congrats   good call,  Lichtman writes in  The Case for Impeachment,  an advance copy of which was shared with POLITICO.  What Trump overlooked, however, was my  next big prediction : that, after winning the presidency, he would be impeached. Trump, of course, didn t investigate any further. If he had, he would realize that Lichtman may have predicted Trump, but that doesn t mean he supports him. In fact, he calls the despot (my word)  an existential threat to humanity. Lichtman s list of possible offenses that could get Trump to that point are familiar: charges of treason with Russia, abuse of power and emoluments violations. Lichtman also cites now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a senator, who argued that a president could be impeached for offenses committed before he took office. Among those potential offenses, Lichtman lists Trump s housing violations, charity problems, potential violations of the Cuba embargo and Trump University.It s all part of a brief   designed to be damning   tour through Trump s history. It includes section headings like  Trump Towers Become Vacant Lots  and  Lying His Way to the Presidency.  It eventually leads Lichtman to the conclusion that Trump might serve himself up for impeachment:  Trump s disregard for lying in sworn testimony, examined in the context of the Bill Clinton precedent, shows how Trump s opponents could set an impeachment trap for him through a civil lawsuit. It wouldn t take much. If Democrats regain the House in 2018, Trump s impeachment is all but guaranteed, but even now, if enough Republicans turn on him, it could easily happen.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
 Australia’s Ex-Foreign Minister Responds To Trump’s Failing Presidency; America Should Listen (VIDEO),"At this point in Donald Trump s pathetic, failing presidency, it is no surprise that officials from other countries want nothing to do with him or America. The country has been humiliated beyond belief as the orange child in the White House unleashes his reckless behavior on the world, and top officials are doing their best to do damage control.This week, Gareth Evans, the former Foreign Minister of Australia, sent out a major warning about Trump and urged Australia to gain more independence away from the United States thanks to Trump s trigger-happy behavior and recent attack on Syria. Evans railed against Trump in his speech to Australia s National Press Club, calling Trump manifestly the most ill-informed, under-prepared, ethically challenged and psychologically ill-equipped president in US history. Evans correctly observed that Trump should not be trusted to deliver consistent, coherent, constructive and cohesive outcomes over the next four years.  The former Australia Foreign Minster added: Personally driven by instinct and impulse, unhampered by knowledge or judgement, he has led an administration acting so far manifestly on the basis of postures, not of policies. Evans urged Australia to depend more on itself and partners in Asia than on the United States, as Trump has made a partnership with America far too risky. Evans said: We should have learned that lesson after Iraq in 2003. You can watch Evans blast Trump s dangerous behavior below:Americans should be seriously considering what other world leaders and important officials are saying about Trump. The fact that the rest of the world is horrified by what they see should be setting off red flags even among Trump s own supporters. Never before have we seen such a response from the world, as Trump threatens to ruin everything he can get his tiny hands on.

 Trump Administration In FREE FALL After ‘Concrete Evidence’ Linking Trump To Russia Emerges (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s undeserved time in the White House may soon come to a gloriously relieving end as one of his biggest scandals threatens to blow up in his face.According to a source close to the investigation examining the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, there is now specific concrete and corroborative evidence  that Trump s inner circle colluded with Russian operatives during the presidential election. The Guardian reported that the U.K. s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which has been watching over the Trump campaign since 2015, has noted several shady  interactions  going on between Trump s people and Russian agents.The GCHQ hadn t been necessarily looking for this information but picked it up during routine surveillance. It wasn t long before other intelligence agencies began to see the same pattern. The U.S. also received information from the  Five Eyes  alliance (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and European agencies in Germany, Estonia, and Poland. The Guardian reported: It is understood that GCHQ was at no point carrying out a targeted operation against Trump or his team or proactively seeking information. The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets. Over several months, different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US. With all of this gathered intelligence taken into consideration, the source close to the investigation said: They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion. This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [Russian] influence relating to the use of hacked material. They [the European agencies] were saying:  There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents. You should be wary of this.  The message was:  Watch out. There s something not right.' As this investigation continues and collusion is confirmed, we might be looking at the end of Trump and his corrupt administration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
" GOP Pundit Compared Trump’s Healthcare Disaster To Martin Luther King, Jr.; He Quickly Regretted It (VIDEO)","Being a pro-Trump pundit must be a tough racket right now.

One of the panelists on CNN Thursday morning happened to be African-American commentator Symone Sanders. As you can imagine, things did not go well for Lord.In a segment discussing the president s plans for Obamacare, Lord called Trump  the Martin Luther King of health care.  Sanders interjected with an  Oh Jeffrey,  but Lord went on,  When I was a kid, President Kennedy did not want to introduce the Civil Rights bill because he said it wasn t popular, he didn t have the votes for it. Dr. King kept putting people in the streets in harm s way to put the pressure on. That s when Sanders stepped in to quash his metaphor:Okay Jeffrey. You do understand that Dr. King was marching for Civil Rights because people that looked like me were being beaten? Dogs were being sicced on them? Basic human rights were being withheld from these people merely because of the color of their skin?

 Is Nothing Sacred? Ivanka Trump’s Passover Family Photo Has Been Exposed As A Fake,"There are big scandals   like Trump s ties to Russia, his repeated flaunting of conflict of interest violations, the nepotism   and then there are small ones. It s the small ones that are most disturbing because of how completely avoidable they are. The Trump family just assumes you re too stupid to notice.Here s a particularly galling example:Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump released a family photo during Passover. That, in and of itself, wouldn t be newsworthy except for the fact that it was a much-needed break from the Trump administration s repugnant treatment of the Jewish community. Kushner s Jewish faith is extremely important to Trump because his staff is rife with anti-Semitic thinkers.Trump s advisor Steve Bannon is a life-long anti-Semite, whose own wife once said he refused to allow his daughters to attend a school with Jewish kids. Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer went on a nonsensical Holocaust denial rant and only apologized hours later when the nation of Israel openly said he needed to resign. Trump s inner circle includes a guy who pledged an oath of loyalty to a pro-fascist Nazi-allied group. In the middle of all of this, Trump no-showed on a Passover seder dinner the White House hosted.So a photograph of Trump s daughter and son-in-law, two key members of his team, celebrating a Jewish holiday might send a positive message to the country. However, like clockwork, even Kushner s Passover family photo quickly turned into something offensive.It turns out that the photo was not, in fact, taken during his Passover celebration. It is an old photo taken on what seems like the Sunday after the inauguration. CNN s Betsy Klein noticed that fact when she realized the entire Trump clan was wearing the same outfits they were photographed in during services at the National Cathedral.It appears the Passover Trump-Kushner family photo was taken the Sunday after inauguration following services at the National Cathedral: pic.twitter.com/p0htM7V8Pi  Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) April 13, 2017Just so incredibly lazy.

The Republican congressman told his constituents that taxpayers don t pay his salary and saying otherwise is  bullcrap. You say you pay for me to do this? That s bullcrap,  video shows Mullin saying. I pay for myself. I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary. This is a service. No one here pays me to go,  he added.Go figure, no one was impressed with his remarks. When his constituents pushed back, Mullin tried to spin his comments, saying,  this is a service for me, not a career, and I thank God this is not how I make my living. Amy Lawrence, Mullin s spokeswoman, told the press that he was just trying to say that he doesn t want to be a  career politician,  that s all. The congressman reiterates in the video that his work as the representative of the Second District of Oklahoma is a service,  Lawrence said. His aspiration is to be a career legislator and not a career politician. He is not, nor does he ever aspire to be, a career politician. His priority will always be to serve his constituents to the best of his ability. Mullins owns Mullin Plumbing, a lucrative company with multiple smaller subsidiaries. But comprehending exactly how this negates the salary he earns as a congressman requires a special type of mental gymnastics. For the record, base pay for a U. S. congressman is $174,000.The good news for Mullin is that after telling his constituents that they don t pay his salary, he probably won t have to worry about the possibility of becoming a career politician.You can watch Mullin sabotage his career below: Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"April 13, 2017"
 GOP Rep Gets RIPPED APART After Saying Sean Spicer Was Right About Hitler,"On Wednesday, GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer opened his mouth and inserted his foot so deep that the nation s top doctors will still be trying to remove it when he inevitably loses his next election in a landslide. According to Cramer, Sean Spicer was kinda right when he presented some  alternative facts  regarding the Holocaust   specifically, his claim that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons (not even in concentration camps or, as Spicer calls them,  Holocaust centers. The media is so gullible, they fall for these things because they think it s really hot stuff and the public just can t wait to stick it to Sean Spicer   who 99% of the people wouldn t have the foggiest idea who he is and it distracts them from other things,  Cramer told conservative radio North Dakota radio host Scott Hennen.  I can t even believe that anybody in the media, much less all of the major networks, led with this story. A spokesperson, who by the way made a poor illustration, but it s not completely, it s not without some validity. I think he apologized and that s the end of it, Cramer said, as though denying the Holocaust can be fixed with a fauxpology.  I think what he was saying is that Hitler didn t take chemical weapons out in a battle-like form and do what Assad did with these children. It s a factual statement,  Cramer says.What Spicer actually said was that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons, which makes him better than Assad: We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You had a, someone who is as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. He later explained that he acknowledges that Hitler took Jewish people to  Holocaust centers  but that Hitler was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing. How are people responding to this? Well, let s just say that the  Sean Spicer was right that Hitler was a good dude compared to Assad  strategy isn t working out for him:North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer is a full blown idiot. Or a Nazi. Or both.  Pinder Binder (@PinderBinder) April 13, 2017Me: I don't think anyone can top Sean Spicer.Kevin Cramer: hold my be .Me: NO!

 Bernie Sanders: Trump’s Dreams Of A Second Term Will Go Up In Smoke,"Sen. Bernie Sanders says that he doesn t think it s likely that Donald Trump will be reelected to a second term now that the American people have had a chance to see what he s really about. Speaking in New York, the Vermont Senator said he thinks that Trump will be a one-term president. In terms of the first three months in office, Donald Trump is the least popular president in the history of polling,  Sanders said. I do not believe that if Trump continues these policies that he s going to be reelected. Nor do I think that the Republicans are going to do well in 2018. Sanders explained that a wave of progressivism has taken hold and is sweeping across the country. This, he added, does not bode well for conservatives. The momentum right now is with the progressive movement in this country,  Sanders said.  And I think the Republicans are on the defensive and will be on the defensive increasingly. The senator offered up Tuesday s special election in Kansas to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo as an example of this trend. Although it was a deep red district that Trump won hands down in the presidential election, Republican candidate Ron Estes just barely managed to scrape by with a narrow win over civil rights attorney James Thompson (D). The Republicans had to spend money like crazy at the end to beat him,  Sanders said.  I think that s a very good omen for the future. Judging by the way the beginning of Trump s presidency has gone, you have to wonder if Trump will even get the chance to run for reelection. The FBI and both houses of Congress are investigating the probability that he colluded with Russia to steal the election. If he is found to have committed treason, he will most likely end up impeached and may have to worry more about a prison term than a second term.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"April 12, 2017"
 WATCH: Reporter Calls Kellyanne Conway And Her Lies ‘The Darkness’ – Her Reply Is INSANELY Ironic,"Everyone knows by now just how fast and loose Kellyanne Conway is with her words. She pioneered  alternative facts.  She claimed that the U.S. had never gone as long without a Treasury Secretary as we did with Trump. She made up an entire terrorist attack. She said that microwaves turn into cameras. And somehow, people still want to talk to her.Some in the press have started seeing her as  the darkness,  because she s such a purveyor of misinformation. That word,  darkness,  refers to the Washington Post s front page motto,  Democracy dies in darkness.  Michael Wolff, a reporter for the Hollywood Reporter, told her: I m going to tell you, when they say  democracy dies in darkness,  you re the darkness. So the Washington Post (and Wolff) is calling her and other purveyors of lies out in their front-page motto. Conway s response was to first say,  I m not the darkness! Then she said: It s what I tell small children: Just because somebody says something doesn t make it true, and it s a great lesson for everyone. Miss Bowling Green Massacre is defending herself against accusations of lies by pointing out that people lie. The irony! It hurts! But it gets even better: You can turn on the TV   more than you can read in the paper because I assume editors are still doing their jobs in most places   and people literally say things that just aren t true. Yes, primarily Fox News and those that like Trump. And herself.

 Republican Compares Lincoln To Hitler; This Time It Wasn’t Sean Spicer,"Whitewashing Hitler and the Holocaust seems to be all the rage among today s Republicans. There was the time when the White House remembered the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance Day, but forgot to mention the Jews, at all. Yesterday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Hitler didn t use chemical weapons. He s been trying, and failing, at backtracking ever since. Now, a Republican in North Carolina, on his Facebook page, compared Abraham Lincoln to Hitler.It was a comment by GOP Legislator Larry Pittman. He posted his newsletter on Facebook, and among the rest of the hate, he commented this to a person telling him to  get over  the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land (something he hopes to overturn, at the state level):And if Hitler had won, should the world just get over it? Lincoln was the same sort if tyrant, and personally responsible for the deaths of over 800,000 Americans in a war that was unnecessary and unconstitutional.Obviously, his followers let him have it, but perhaps the best answer was this one:The Civil War was unnecessary and unconstitutional? What on earth were you thinking? The Republican Party used to be   proudly   called the Party of Lincoln. I have no idea what to call it now, at least that could be repeated in polite company.Couldn t NC Rep #LarryPittman find someone else to compare #Hitler to rather than #Lincoln ? @maddow #ncpol https://t.co/4sjhsCHPOs pic.twitter.com/LLSQv6y47q  Indy Week (@indyweek) April 12, 2017Pittman clearly has no idea whatsoever what the Constitution says or he would not be putting forth a bill that would try to nullify federal law. That is against the Constitution. Now, so is slavery, although I m sure that s something else Pittman would like to nullify.Racism is nothing new for Pittman. Like Donald Trump, he was a birther. He said this about President Obama: Someone had posted something [on Facebook] with a picture of Barack Obama and across it said  traitor,    Pittman said.  And, you know, I don t always agree with the guy, I certainly didn t vote for him but I gotta defend him on this one. I just don t think it s right at all to call Barack Obama a traitor. There s a lot of things he s done wrong but he is not a traitor. Not as far as I can tell. I haven t come across any evidence yet that he has done one thing to harm Kenya.

 WATCH: Trump’s Attorney Flat-Out ADMITS Trump Admin Just Too Intellectually Lazy To Study Facts,"Trump s Syrian policy is all over the place, to the point where The Economist actually published a story saying,  Wanted: a coherent Syria policy.  Trump s position was  let Syria handle its own problems,  right up until Assad dropped sarin gas on his people. It wasn t until the images of poisoned children started coming in that he decided we needed to respond. Why?Trump s attorney, Michael Cohen, appeared on CNN with Chris Cuomo to discuss President Flip-Flop s new Syria policy. Cuomo asked why Trump would shift from a hands-off-Syria policy to an intervene-now policy, and Cohen s response was downright frightening: When we were watching, whether it was here on CNN or any of the other stations, the Syrian refugees that were leaving, they weren t the young. They weren t the aged. They weren t women. They were all these 19 to 25-year-old men that when they were walking to these makeshift homes in Germany that they put up for them, it looked like a military operation. Cuomo responded by saying that those videos were selective, and the numbers and facts painted a very different picture of the refugees coming out of Syria.  Yes, you have young men, but those refugees are the same people that the president is saying he cares so much about. Cuomo is referring to the sheer hypocrisy of this administration s current Syria policy: Assad is gassed his own people, including women and children, but Trump doesn t want to accept the refugees Assad s regime creates. Unfortunately, that didn t sway Cohen, who doubled down on the idea that misleading videos are more reliable than data and facts:CUOMO: Yeah, the question is, why were people picking those videos? Was it misleading? The data would say yes.COHEN: But maybe it wasn t misleading. Maybe it was more of the reality, what was going on.CUOMO: No, but the numbers, Michael, say it s not the reality.COHEN: Again, I don t want to start talking about numbers. Numbers have not proven to suit me well.And there it is: Cohen and Trump and probably a large chunk of the entire administration is too intellectually lazy to try and understand facts and data.Watch the full exchange below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Campaign Manager Registering As Foreign Agent After Lobbying For Russian Interests,"Donald Trump s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is now retroactively registering as a foreign agent   the new term for  traitor,  apparently   after the water got a bit too hot with regard to his lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Putin Ukranian party.BREAKING: Spokesman says former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is registering with US gov't as foreign agent.  The Associated Press (@AP) April 12, 2017According to a Manafort spokesman his work on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine which sought to promote Vladimir Putin s agenda in Washington, began before he joined the Trump campaign, though it is not clear if The Donald knew about this when he hired him. Of course, it is unlikely that The Donald would have cared given his response to Michael Flynn s work on behalf of foreign powers (he kept Flynn around until he was practically forced to get rid of him). The Associated Press reports:A Washington lobbying firm that worked under the direction of two former Trump campaign advisers has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. The firm said its work could have benefited the Ukrainian government.The Podesta Group s cited details of lobbying it performed from 2012 through 2014 on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The firm reported being paid more than $1.2 million for the effort.The disclosure follows reporting by the AP in August that the firm of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, who served in a senior role in the Trump campaign, had overseen the lobbying effort. The effort sought to promote a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party s interests in Washington.This is now the second person associated with Donald Trump s team who has retroactively registered as a foreign agent.Something is rotten in the state of Denmark err, the United States.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Surrogate: Carter Page Being A Russian Agent Isn’t Evidence Of ‘Collusion’ (VIDEO),"If you haven t heard, former Trump advisor Carter Page was the subject of a successfully-executed FISA warrant because of his dealings with Russia. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa notes that the bar to obtain a warrant is extremely high and that the process of obtaining one  includes too many layers of approval to be granted without strong evidence.  Nevertheless, Trump and his associates continue to complain that members of his campaign and administration became the subject of investigations because of their illegal activity.On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Page became the focus of an investigation because a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge was thoroughly convinced that there was  probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia. Appearing on CNN, braindead Trump lemming Kayleigh McEnany worked hard to dispel any idea that Page colluding with Russia is evidence that members of the campaign colluding with Russia. I don t think it s evidence of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia at all,  she said.  He was a brief adviser on the campaign, and the campaign [was] trying to distance themselves from him.  In reality, Page was one of the first foreign policy advisors Trump named. But look, I don t think we have any evidence to suggest that President Trump knew that this guy was a foreign agent, and he wanted him on his campaign because he wanted to collude with Russia,  he said.  That is another step that you have to make, and I don t think there are facts there to show that. Here s the thing: whether or not Trump knew is a nonissue. When Trump was warned about Michael Flynn s shady dealing with Russia, he brushed it off and kept the disgraced General on as national security advisor. He even fired the person who warned him. It would not have mattered to Trump if he knew about Page, because for some reason it s cool to work with Russia under President* Trump.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Attacks James Comey For Not Jailing Clinton: ‘She Was Guilty Of Every Charge’ (VIDEO),"In an interview with Fox Business that aired Tuesday, Donald Trump responded to news that the FBI had successfully obtained a FISA warrant to look into his former advisor Carter Page by trashing James Comey for not locking Hillary Clinton up. Sure, Clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything, but according to Trump she is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY. When Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. He saved her life, Trump said, apparently forgetting that a certain letter from Comey helped swing the election his way. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge, and then he said she was essentially OK. Nevertheless, for some reason Trump says he trusts Comey to clear him with regard to Russia.Trump also complained that he is understaffed because of  obstructionist  Democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants   like  the law.  In reality, the problem is that The Donald isn t actually nominating people. Democrats have only  obstructed  when there was a legitimate objection, like that the person worked with Russia or is a white supremacist.Trump told Fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused President Obama of  tapping  his  wires  at Trump Tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the FBI for their illegal activities (many involving Russia). While it is true that Trump Tower was monitored years ago, it had more to do with the Russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below Trump s penthouse than anything else. Over 30 Russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Brags About The ‘Beautiful Chocolate Cake’ He Was Eating When He Attacked Syria (VIDEO),"Trump, channeling Marie Antoinette, decided to share how he spent the moments leading up to committing an act of war against Syria: He was in Mar-a-Lago s dining room eating  the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake. True to form, Trump couldn t help but brag about the quality of dessert he was eating while relaying his war story to Fox s Maria Bartiromo who got an exclusive sit down with Trump to talk about his impulsive decision to take the country to the brink of war.Trump, who advocates cutting food programs for disadvantaged school children, thought America would want to know how great the Mar-a-Lago cakes are. I was sitting at the table, we had finished eating, we were now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever had. Words failing him, Trump outstretched his hands and gave an approximate size. Since he s a big boy and was behaving well at dinner, Trump got an extra bigly slice of chocolate cake. He was also quick to note that the President of China loved the chocolate cake. It s now been 30 seconds since he was asked to describe his order to attack Syria. He hadn t mentioned the country once.In fact, when Trump gets around to describing the country he just attacked he calls it Iraq.

" FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it. Page, of course, is no exception.The FBI officials did not reveal if the investigation uncovered evidence of a crime, but Page and the rest of the crew are acting very, very guilty.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 12, 2017"
 New York Daily News Cover SAVAGES White House For Spicer’s Hitler Gaffe (IMAGE),"The New York Daily News is not known for subtlety when it comes to its covers. The snarky newspaper pulled no punches when it came to using its cover to go after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling concentration camps  Holocaust Centers  and invoking Nazi butcher Adolf Hitler when talking about Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Wednesday morning s cover reads: Nazis murdered 2.7 million Jews, gassing 6,000 a day in Auschwtiz alone FORGOTTEN BY WHITE HOUSE Here is the image of that cover via New York Daily News Twitter:Of course, The New York Daily News isn t the first to go after Spicer for these remarks. The Anne Frank Center has called on Donald Trump to fire Spicer, as has House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Further, this is part of a disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism from Team Trump. During the campaign he regularly retweeted white supremacists, most infamously when he tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton over a pile of money with a Star of David that said,  Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.  This tweet caused such an uproar that House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to speak out about it. After he was elected, Trump s White House deliberately left any mention of Jewish people out of their Holocaust Remembrance Day statement. And, of course, no one can forget that we have avowed white supremacists working in the West Wing.To that end, if this administration doesn t want to be called bigots, they need to stop acting like it. Get rid of the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, and other assorted overtly bigoted people.Don t hold your breath on that one, though. We ll have four years of this kind of stuff. The only silver lining may be that in the end, the GOP can no longer say that they don t traffic in bigotry, since it s right there in the White House for all to see, while their party is in charge.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Chelsea Clinton Has A Little Advice For Sean Spicer After He Defends Hitler,"White House Secretary Sean Spicer decided to rewrite history on Tuesday, arguing that Adolf Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all because he didn t use chemical weapons like Assad.

I hope @PressSec takes time to visit @HolocaustMuseum,  the former first daughter tweeted this afternoon.

He was trying to convince the world that Donald Trump was right to bomb Syria but only ended up proving that he s a total idiot.When Spicer was called out on his ridiculous assertion that Hitler didn t gas millions of people in concentration camps, he grabbed a shovel and dug his hole deeper. Passing the point of no return, the press secretary argued that Hitler didn t gas his own people, just the Jews. And apparently, they don t count.Everybody except Trump s loyal base of anti-Semitic holocaust deniers knows that Spicer s version of history is a long, long way from the truth and it may be the worst excuse ever used to justify military action.People are justifiably outraged. The Anne Frank Center issued a statement calling for Spicer s resignation.  Spicer s statement is the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary,   said Steven Goldstein, the organization s executive director.  Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve  and  President Trump must fire him at once,  he added.Spicer would be wise to take Clinton s advice and study up a little on the holocaust before the next time he decides to spout off about what a swell guy Hitler was.Featured image via Marcus Ingram/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2017"
 New Trump Comments Confirm That Bannon Could Be On His Way OUT (DETAILS),"There have been weeks of reports that White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Senior Adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner have been at each other s throats. Reportedly, the infighting is so bad that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had to moderate a meeting between the two so that they could call a truce. Now, new comments from Donald Trump suggest that he s not so hot on Bannon these days, and if it comes down to it in a knock down, drag out, Bannon v. Kushner fight, Kushner will definitely emerge the victor.Michael Goodwin of the New York Post asked Donald Trump if he was still confident in Bannon s abilities, and for the first time, Trump didn t give a full-throated defense of his white supremacist Chief Strategist. In fact, he seemed to want to downplay the level of Bannon s influence in both the campaign and the White House. Trump told Goodwin: I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late. I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn t know Steve. I m my own strategist and it wasn t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. When White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the Bannon v. Kushner feud, he tried to say that the media was making too much of it: There s a lot of stuff that was overblown about this that makes it out into the media sometimes and gets a little more sensational than it really is. Of course, this directly contradicts Trump s comments to the New York Post. In addition to the aforementioned statements, Trump also said: Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will. So, in other words, it looks like Bannon is on the chopping block. Perhaps the rest of the white nationalist Pepe brigade will be ousted with him if and when he goes.

 Those Intel Reports That Nunes Ran To Trump With Reveal A BOMBSHELL That Trump Will HATE,"Remember the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into the Trump-Russia connection, and how Chairman Devin Nunes compromised it by running to Trump with documents he should have shown to his fellow committee members first? And how he then had to recuse himself from the investigation for all of that? It seems that those documents do, in fact, contain a bombshell, but it s not the one that Trump insisted we d find.House Republicans and Democrats have completed their review of those documents, and they demonstrate that nobody in the Obama administration wiretapped Trump at any time, nor did they do anything unusual, let alone illegal, with foreign surveillance. Even the  scandal  that Republicans tried to create around Susan Rice s request to unmask certain members of Trump s campaign turned out to be a big ol  nothingburger.One particular Congressional source said that Rice s requests were both normal and appropriate, and another said that there are  absolutely  no smoking guns present that demonstrate Rice and Obama did anything wrong. This vindicates Rice s assertions that her requests were normal: There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a US person was referred to   name not provided, just a US person   and sometimes in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report, and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to who the US official was.The notion that some people are trying to suggest, is that by asking for the identity of a person is leaking it, is unequivocally false. There is no connection between unmasking and leaking. Trump isn t going to like this. It makes him look like a bigger paranoid, narcissistic moron than ever over these tweets:Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J.

When he was asked whether he thought Rice acted illegally, he said,  Do I think? Yes, I think. He also said: I think it s going to be the biggest story. It s such an important story for our country and the world. Nunes looks like an idiot too, and now should probably resign his chairmanship. If Trump says anything, expect him to double down on his accusations.

 Spicer Has Epic Freudian Slip During His Half-Assed Apology For Hitler Comments (VIDEO),"Sean Spicer s is having a very, very bad day.While the Jewish community celebrated Passover, Spicer claimed that Adolf Hitler never gassed people. After immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never gassed German citizens. After another immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never specifically bombed people with chemical weapons, merely gassed them in concentration camps (which he bizarrely called  holocaust centers ). By this point, he had proven his original point was nonsensical and still offensive, while also proving that he was a bad liar.It would take him a few more hours   and a call from the Israeli government asking that he resign  before he got around to begrudgingly apologizing. And he managed to screw that up too.While speaking with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, Spicer claimed he didn t want his Hitler comments to be a  distraction  from Trump s efforts. What efforts exactly? Allow Spicer, seen here stepping on every metaphorical rake in the yard, to explain with characteristic rambling, jumbled sentences:I needed to make sure I clarified and not in any way, shape or form any more of a distraction from the president s decisive action in Syria and the attempts that he s making to destabilize the region.Sean accidentally just said the quiet part loud.

Trump s son Eric would clear things up when he openly admitted Trump impulsively decided to issue the strike after his daughter Ivanka asked him to.Instead, Trump s Middle Eastern efforts continue to be haphazard and counterproductive.

 Dan Rather Says What Every Person With A Moral Compass Is Thinking Regarding Sean Spicer & Trump,"It s gotten to the point where if Donald Trump doesn t fire Sean Spicer for his egregious remarks about the Holocaust, Assad and Syria, he should be seen as agreeing with Spicer s sentiment as well as condoning it.It s disgusting, to say the least, and the legendary Dan Rather just released a statement that should summarize what every person with a decent moral compass is thinking right now.Rather wrote: It is with sadness that I do not know where to begin. Today in a briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement that is so far beyond the pale, so tone deaf and blind to history and our precarious moment in world affairs, that it is with only a heavy heart that I even bring attention to it. There can be no joy in such incompetence.In trying to make the case for the Administration s policy in Syria and vis a vis Russia which is confused to be generous, and wildly chaotic to be more precise, Mr. Spicer said,  We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons.  He continued,  So you have to, if you are Russia, ask yourself: Is this a country and a regime that you want to align yourself with?  When asked to clarify, Mr. Spicer said,  I think when you come to sarin gas, he (Hitler) was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.  Mr. Spicer went on to mention  Holocaust centers,  in an apparent reference to the Nazi concentration camps.This line of rhetoric is so unhinged, so amateurish, so lacking in the context and perspective necessary for statesmanship and diplomacy that I do not see how Mr. Spicer can be allowed to continue in his current position. But in the end, this is less about him and more about an Administration that is inserting itself in a civil war and now is plunging into a drastic reformulation of American foreign policy without any clear sense that they have a plan. When you try to explain such a situation, it is understandable that your words don t make sense.A bar, already set low, continues to drop. If Trump doesn t fire Spicer then he is fully condoning Holocaust denial within his administration. This shouldn t only outrage America, but cause a massive resistance against the current administration that has never been seen before. This must not be condoned or accepted. It is not okay.Featured Photo by Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"April 11, 2017"
 Jeff Sessions’ Written Immigration Speech Puts His REVOLTING Beliefs About Immigrants On Display,"The Trump administration is working as hard as it can to fulfill its promise of cracking down on illegal immigration, and part of that promise was, more or less, to be as evil as possible so they won t even want to come over here. Now, Jeff Sessions is starting to work on putting this into practice, including pushing for more severe prosecutions and punishments, even for non-violent immigrants.But it s not what he s doing that s so horrid. It s horrid, but not nearly as much so as what he planned to called them in a speech to Border Patrol agents in Nogales. His planned remarks included this vile portion: It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.This is a new era. This is the Trump era. Now, that supposedly was referring only to criminal organizations like gangs and cartels. However, many of the people who cross the border illegally are doing so to escape those very organizations   not to expand them into the U.S.He didn t actually say this in his speech in Nogales, but it was in his prepared remarks. The fact that it was even there shows exactly how he sees undocumented immigrants. They re chattel, they re dirty, disgusting animals, and they re any number of things other than human beings to him.Undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than citizens. People like to point to the fact that they make up a large share of inmates in federal prisons, but federal prisons are a small part of the total prison system in the U.S. ICE s recent numbers aren t especially telling, either since their current focus is immigrants with criminal convictions (which is why they re stalking courthouses).Trump once said that undocumented immigrants were rapists and murderers,  and some, I assume, are good people.  Sessions is building upon that view of undocumented immigrants as mostly criminals, and no amount of,  We re talking about criminal organizations  is going to change that until this administration changes its attitude.Featured image by Michael B.

 Anne Frank Center SAVAGES Spicer After He Said Hitler Didn’t Gas Jews At ‘Holocaust Centers’ (TWEETS),"It s no secret that a large percentage of the Trump administration thinks the Holocaust didn t happen (or, if they do, they think Hitler had it right), but even The Donald s harshest critics didn t expect the White House Press Secretary to openly deny the Holocaust during a press briefing. But, of course, this is the Trump administration where up is down, taking food from the poor is  compassionate,  and Hitler didn t gas the Jews.On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer attempted to defend Trump s seemingly pointless (unless the point was to make himself a whole lot of money through investments in the company that makes the missiles used) bombing run in Syria that he authorized because Ivanka was having a sad day. According to Spicer, Assad is much worse than Hitler becauseat least he didn t use chemical weapons on his people like Syria s president does. We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You had a, someone who is as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons,  Spicer told a room full of almost certainly stunned reporters. In other words, Zyklon B didn t exist and concentration camps   Spicer called them  Holocaust centers    were just fun places where stuff happened that totally didn t involve chemical weapons being used on Jewish people.Shortly after Spicer said the Holocaust didn t happen, the Anne Frank Center stepped up to take his words and shove them down his throat with such force that they traveled through time and shot out the seat of his great grandson s pants in the middle of his Speech final.

" Trump White House Is About To Screw Up Easter For 1,000s Of Little Children","If you re keeping track, so far, Donald Trump has screwed up two military missions, his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, his tax plan, and now, Easter.Just days before Christians  most holy day, the Trump White House still is not preoared for the annual easter egg hunt on the White House lawn. While this is symbolic, it s a big symbol.The Sunday tradition is 138 years old, and as Melinda Bates, the Easter event organizer behind President Bill Clinton s eight times as host, told The New York Times,  It s the single most high-profile event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on.  From her perspective, the outcome of the event is an indication of the administration s inner workings.Source: SalonFor this we can blame the First Lady   no, not the First Daughter First Lady   Melania. First Ladies have a job in this country and the Easter Egg hunt is one of them. Her refusal to leave her comfy home in Manhattan means thousands of children, including children of military personnel, could go without a favorite Easter pasttime.Some even took to reaching out to the FLOTUS on the one place they know they can find her husband: Twitter:@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near. Please reach out! pic.twitter.com/D78YqWVPBi  Wells Wood Turning (@WellsTurning) February 20, 2017This event is actually pretty huge. About 4,000 school children receive tickets every year and about 3,000 children of military familes. They may all be disappointed. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it,  Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of the American Military Partner Association told the Times. Congress members have also not been contacted about tickets for their constituents.Because of this, the event has been cut in half and they ll only have about 1/5th of the security, and it s all because the First Lady has been neglegent in even staffing her office. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event,  the Times reported.The vacant positions are cause for concern, according to Bates.  I m really concerned for the Trump people. This thing is all hands on deck. In her defense, this is all par for the course for the Trump administration, whose motto just seems to be  wing it and hope things don t get too screwed up.

 Sean Spicer Claims Hitler Never Gassed People In Outrageous Defense Of Syrian Bombing (VIDEO),"Sean Spicer s time as press secretary has been a particularly humiliating one. Each time he goes up to the podium, he lies or fumbles. And today, he reached a particularly pathetic low point when he seemingly erased the holocaust from history with a single outrageous claim. The timing was especially bad as Trump s administration dodges accusations of anti-Semitism and the Jewish community celebrates the holiday of the Passover seder.According to Spicer s version of events, Hitler never gassed people.WATCH: Sean Spicer: ""You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons."" pic.twitter.com/WdI6bu1wJj  Yashar (@yashar) April 11, 2017Spicer comment came while he hamfistedly attempted to justify bombing Syria because of the Assad regime s use of chemical weapons. In an effort to prove his point, Spicer claimed Hitler   perpetrator of the worst mass murder in history   never used chemical weapons because he found them so immoral. Undoubtedly Spicer was referring to the fact that Hitler was said to have opposed chemical weapons on the battlefield because of his experience being gassed in World War I. However, Hitler and the Nazi party had absolutely no qualms with gassing their victims in the concentration camps, which they did on an industrial scale. (In fact, the idea that Hitler was gassed in WWI is actually suspected by historians to be a lie invented by Hitler himself to cover for his long history of mental illness. Passing along this myth is perpetuating an artful piece of propaganda invented by Hitler. Nice going, Spicey.)To suggest that Hitler wouldn t  sink to using chemical weapons  is an outrageous way of dehumanizing those who died in the holocaust. For him to say this while standing at the podium at the White House is sickening. More hypocritically, Trump himself praised the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein as recently as last summer, suggesting they allowed him to keep his enemies in line. His bombing of Syria came as a shock precisely because he has shown absolutely zero interest in preventing chemical warfare up until this point. Disturbingly, the United States has a sordid history with chemical weapons stockpiles dating back to the first World War. It was not until the 1990s that the U.S. firmly committed to getting rid of them.Asked for clarification, Spicer then tried to make a distinction between Jews and Germans. Gassing the Jewish people in concentration camps is different than gassing  your own people.  Another defense that neo-Nazis continue to use to this day. The hole Spicer is digging keeps getting deeper.Press Sec. on Hitler/Assad comments: ""He was not using the gas on his own people the same way he brought them into the Holocaust centers."" pic.twitter.com/mO9EsWM4QT  ABC News (@ABC) April 11, 2017Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 11, 2017"
 United Just Took A DISGUSTING Step To Smear The Victim At The Heart Of Viral PR Disaster,"United Airlines is in an economic and pulic relations tailspin after they were caught on tape brutally dragging a passenger from a plane after he refused to leave. The man, David Dao, is a doctor, and he was left bloody when he was physically forced to disembark because the plane was overbooked. Now, United is taking a page straight from the GOP playbook and using the media to trash Dr. Dao s past.This article appeared today in Kentucky s Courier-Journal and is making its rounds throughout the media. Apparently, according to the paper, the doctor has a  troubled past,  as if that has anything at all to do with Monday s horrific incident.Dao, who went to medical school in Vietnam in the 1970s before moving to the U.S., was working as a pulmonologist in Elizabethtown when he was arrested in 2003 and eventually convicted of drug-related offenses after an undercover investigation, according to documents filed with the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure last June. The documents allege that he was involved in fraudulent prescriptions for controlled substances and was sexually involved with a patient who used to work for his practice and assisted police in building a case against him.Dao was convicted of multiple felony counts of obtaining drugs by fraud or deceit in November 2004 and was placed on five years of supervised probation in January 2005. He surrendered his medical license the next month.Who cares?Victim blaming is nothing new. Every woman who has ever been assaulted knows all about it. Republicans and Fox News have turned it into an art form.We ve seen it before. They blamed Trayvon Martin for his death. Hell, they blame every African-American who dies the hands of cops (and wannabe cops).Fox even (of course they do) blames the victims of their own predators. They victim blamed a woman who dared speak out on behalf of all women. The right even blames victims of gun violence for not being armed.Now, we don t know for sure that United (or the Chicago Police Department, who actually did the dragging) planted the story in the media, but it s a pretty reasonable guess, especially after United s CEO, Oscar Munoz, trashed the victim in a letter to his staff.The bottom line is that it shouldn t and doesn t matter what the doctor did 10 years ago. Unless he is an escaped convict, he has the same rights as anyone else on that plane.Featured image via video screen capture.",News,"April 11, 2017"
 Eric Trump Accidentally Exposes Who Was Behind Syria Strike And The Whole Trump Family’s In Trouble,"Eric Trump sat down with the Telegraph and things quickly went off the rails. Eric  for years seen as the dumb one    blundered his way through the interview with such lack of self-awareness that he wound up revealing a bunch of stuff he shouldn t have. But there is one tone-deaf comment that Eric Trump made that you ll want to keep in the back of your mind throughout the rest of this story. When asked about his father s desire to make the White House a Trump family affair, Eric said: Is that nepotism? Absolutely. Is that also a beautiful thing? Absolutely. Family business is a beautiful thing. A lot of ink has been spilled speculating on what Trump s presidential  doctrine  is, but the answer is painfully simple: Rank nepotism. Paranoid and alienated, Trump s only allies in Washington are his own children and he s been furthering his separation from the rest of his staff by leaning on them with increasing regularity. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner has recently become the most powerful person in the country. His only qualification is getting married to Ivanka.Unfortunately, it gets worse. Donald Trump isn t just placing his close family and friends in positions they have no business being in, but also allowing those inexperienced cronies the chance to influence American military operations. According to Eric, his sister Ivanka was actually the architect of the decision to bomb Syria. Until January 20, Ivanka s career was in selling cheap jewelry made in China to fans of her father s reality tv show. She now has a seat at the table in starting a world war.[Eric] confirmed that President Trump s decision to bomb a Syrian airbase to punish President Bashar al-Assad for a nerve gas attack last week was influenced by the reaction of his sister Ivanka, who said she was  heartbroken and outraged  by the atrocity.That he was listening to his daughter and not his advisers explains why the Trump White House seemed chaotic and clueless in the hours after the bombing. Nobody was on the same page. Trump s UN ambassador and his Secretary of State were issuing conflicting statements about the intent of the bombings. Other staff initially bragged about destroying the airfield. Trump contradicted them by saying he intentionally didn t destroy the airfield. Nobody knew what was going on   except maybe Ivanka, a person with no official job in the White House.Adding to the confusion, Trump himself once praised Saddam Hussein for using chemical weapons on his enemies. It was jarring to watch him claim that Assad s use of sarin gas was so personally offensive to him that he had to go to war. Eric s confession that it was Ivanka s decision fills in a lot of blanks.The fact that Eric would freely admit that this is how the White House is being run goes back to his observation that nepotism is  beautiful.  Living all his life in the shadow of his dad, it seems as though he and his siblings aren t aware of how gross this whole thing is. They are second-generation silver spooners. Their dad owes his success to their grandfather. They are so far removed from the real world that they ve forgotten they never earned anything.And they are running the country.

 What This Poll Says About Bernie Sanders And Republicans Should TERRIFY The GOP,"Senator Bernie Sanders is the most popular senator in the United States and a new poll proves it. The latest Morning Consult poll to come out has found that, out of all the lawmakers serving in the United States Senate, the Vermont senator has the highest approval ratings among his constituents.The poll revealed that a whopping 75 percent of Sanders  constituents approve of his performance. Only 21 percent of Vermont residents who were polled disapprove of the senator.In contrast to the glowing endorsements Sanders received from his constituents, Mitch McConnell had the lowest approval rating of any U.S. senator. A measly 44 percent of the Kentucky lawmaker s constituents approved of his performance in office, while 47 percent disapproved of him. McConnell has earned himself a special achievement, being the only senator to have more of his constituents disapprove of his performance than approve.Sanders and McConnell were also voted the most liked and least liked, respectively, in September of 2016 and have held on to their titles since then.The runners up for the least liked were Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who came in second with a disapproval rating of 43 percent and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who was in third place at 40 percent.According to the Morning Consult website, more than 85,000 registered voters were included in  weekly online national polling from January 2017 through March 2017 to determine the latest Senator & Governor Approval Rankings.  In each poll, they were asked whether they approved or disapproved of the senator in question and were then asked a series of questions about his/her performance that they could answer with  strongly approve, somewhat approve, somewhat disapprove, strongly disapprove, or don t know / no opinion. This poll does not account for the fact that Bernie Sanders is loved far and wide, not just in Vermont. After building one heck of a movement during the Democratic presidential primaries, he has remained a powerful voice in politics and maintains a loyal following across the country.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2017"
 WATCH Bill O’Reilly Get INSANELY Vile Over Bloodied United Passenger – It’s SICK Even For Him,"We ve been abuzz all day about a doctor who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight at Chicago s O Hare International Airport. Chicago Department of Aviation police yanked him out of his seat so hard his face hit the armrest and he ended up in the hospital. Most people who have any kind of a conscience are outraged, as well they should be, because there are a zillion things wrong with this scenario.Bill O Reilly, on the other hand, doesn t seem to be all that outraged over it. His reaction was positively disgusting. Seriously. After showing the video, he literally laughed. Then he said: I shouldn t be laughing but it s just so bizarre. Good lord, does the man have any decency at all? Oh, wait, we know the answer to that already. Yes, it s bizarre, but not in a way that warrants laughing. How black does your soul have to be to laugh at something like this? Watch below:United had oversold this particular flight and was having trouble getting people to voluntarily give up their seats so they could get a flight crew to Louisville. With no volunteers, they randomly selected four people to be bumped, and this doctor was one of them.

 Congress Steps In After Doctor Is Violently Dragged From United Airlines Flight,"Video of a passenger being violently dragged from a United Airlines flight has gone viral, and now Congress wants answers.Audra D. Bridges, who filmed the shocking video and posted it to social media, told the Courier-Journal that passengers were informed that the flight was overbooked at the gate. The airline originally said that one person would need to give up their seat. After everyone had boarded the plane, they were told that four passengers would have to give up the seat they had paid for so that airline employees would be able to fly instead.They asked for volunteers and even offered money and hotel accommodations to sweeten the deal. But when no one offered to leave the plane, they randomly selected passengers to kick off the flight. When the man they had chosen to boot out of the seat he paid for said he didn t want to leave because he was a doctor and had patients he had to care for in the morning, United Airlines called the police.In the video, you can see the cops forcefully grab the doctor and violently drag him off the plane while he screams out in pain. Other passengers were horrified. He was eventually allowed back on the plane, bleeding mouth and all.Now, Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is demanding answers. Norton is calling for a congressional hearing into the incident. I deplore the violent removal of a passenger from a United Airlines flight this weekend. Airline passengers must have protections against such abusive treatment. I am asking our committee for a hearing, which will allow us to question airport police, United Airlines personnel, and airport officials, among others, about whether appropriate procedures were in place in Chicago and are in place across the United States when passengers are asked to leave a flight,  Norton said in a statement.Norton said that she will be following up with a letter to committee chairman Rep.

" Sean Spicer BLOWS Press Briefing, Contradicts Trump Administration With INSANE Statement On Russia (VIDEO)","Donald Trump may have been cozying up to Russia during his presidential campaign and the beginning of his presidency, but it looks like the relationship is turning sour thanks to his reckless decision to attack Syria, one of Russia s allies.Russia openly condemned the attack, and even threatened to retaliate against the United States thanks to Trump. However, White House Press Secretary must have not gotten the memo, because he called Russia one of America s allies in reference to Syria during his press briefing on Monday.Not only is that statement false (especially after this Syria fiasco) but Spicer greatly contradicted many people in the Trump administration, and even Trump himself. It s obvious that Russia is a hostile power   not an ally   but Spicer still said that America would work with allies, including Russia, in committing to ensuring that there are places that are free from violence You can watch Spicer make a fool of himself below:To be fair, Trump s administration does seem to be awfully confused about how it feels about Russia. One one hand, Trump has showed Russian leader Vladimir Putin with praise, yet at times insists that he doesn t know Putin at all. Nikki Haley, our United Nations ambassador, has said Russia cannot be trusted. After the attack in Syria, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insulted Russia and said the country was complicit or incompetent. New National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster considers Russia an adversary.If only the Trump administration could actually send a unified, coherent message  but in an administration this incompetent, chaotic, and corrupt, we shouldn t expect too much.

 This Poll Shows EXACTLY How Much Americans Detest Trump,"At this point in Trump s disastrous presidency, it s pretty clear that the only one that thinks he s doing a great job is the underserving POTUS himself. Even his own supporters have lost faith in him and are turning away at record speed. Despite his rapidly plummeting approval rating, Trump still thinks he s the greatest thing to happen to America   or at least, he ll continue to think that until he sees this:According to MSNBC s Kyle Griffin, Americans are so turned off by Trump that they don t even want to get anywhere near a product he touches. Apparently, asking for Trump s support is so toxic that it is basically suicide for businesses. That s quite strange for a reality television star who brags about how good of a businessman he is.Already, we saw Trump make endorsements on his Twitter feed. It turns out, those inappropriate  shoutouts  did way more harm than good. NBC News reported: When Donald Trump won the Oval Office, critics worried he would use his elevated stature to enhance his personal power to pick winners and losers by endorsing products. But new consumer survey data from Simmons Research suggest the Trump presidency may be having the opposite effect on the Trump brand. According to the new data, 78% of Americans would not use and might even boycott any product that Trump endorses. Even amongst Republicans, support is low   only 31% of GOPers said they would be more likely to use a product if Trump endorsed it. Simmons scientist Steven Millman explained this phenomenon: A strong association between Trump and a brand is likely to be damaging to the brand, unless its consumers are strong conservative. This actually makes perfect sense. Trump has singlehandedly destroyed his own Trump brand by creating one of the most hateful, controversial presidential campaigns America had ever seen. His hotels are going down in flames, and so are his other self-branded companies. Even his daughter, Ivanka, is facing business struggles thanks to her father s horrible performance. So it only seems pretty natural that the association with Trump s disgraced name would have the same effect on other businesses.It s official: most of America hates Trump, and we want him to know it.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
" BREAKING: Republican Governor Arrested On Multiple Charges, GOP In CHAOS","It s the end of Alabama Governor Robert Bentley s political career after he was arrested Monday on charges related to the numerous things he did to cover up an affair. The governor was booked into Montgomery County Jail on two charges related to his failure to disclose campaign information and submitted a letter of resignation shortly afterward.The scandal began to make its way to the public when Bentley fired the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, Spencer Collier, who later revealed that he had investigated and seen evidence of an affair between the 74-year-old Bentley and his campaign spokeswoman, Rebekah Mason. This is of course odd given Bentley s opposition to gay marriage on the  one man one woman  basis, but having an affair is not illegal. Unfortunately for him, the rest of the stuff he did is. A press release from the Alabama Ethics Commission details the rest:Today, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause to believe that Governor Robert Bentley committed violations of both the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act. We have referred those matters to the Montgomery County District Attorney for further consideration and possible prosecution.Intentional violations of the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act are Class B felonies. The range of punishment for a Class B felony is a prison sentence of between 2 and 20 years per violation, and a fine of up to $20,000.00, per violation. As these matters are still ongoing, the Commission is prohibited by law from any further comment regarding any of the evidence produced or presented in this case.Over the course of this year-long investigation, the Alabama Ethics Commission issued more subpoenas than have been issued by the Commission since it was given subpoena power. Chief Special Agent Tony Goubil and Special Agent Dustin Lansford devoted countless hours in conducting this investigation. They interviewed over 45 witnesses and have analyzed over 33,000 documents in the course of their investigation. The staff of the Commission has worked tirelessly and thoroughly to investigate every Complaint that we received. The evidence was reviewed and tested multiple times by career lawyers. These lawyers include Hugh Evans our General Counsel who has devoted his career to Ethics, as well as our new Assistant General Counsel, Cynthia Propst Raulston, a career prosecutor whose experience includes analyzing and successfully trying complex white collar and public corruption cases to conclusion before juries. Our Commissioners, who include two retired Circuit Judges, two career attorneys and a doctor, all of whom have vast experience sifting through evidence, judging the testimony of witnesses and applying difficult principles in a fair, even-handed manner, ultimately weighed the evidence and returned this finding.Justice (if you can call it that) moved swiftly after his arrest. Bentley copped a plea and was fined $2,000 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. He also agreed not to run for office again..@GovernorBentley:  I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama s governor   FTR #ForTheRecord @MSNBC https://t.co/AMmmRIrxBF  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) April 10, 2017This, as strange as it sounds, should strike fear in the heart of Donald Trump. As a man who regularly bullies anyone who criticizes him or correctly states inconvenient facts and as someone who has a history of firing people who were investigating him or those close to him, Bentley s arrest should be a clear message that no matter how much you abuse your power to cover up something   in Trump s case his campaign s collusion with a hostile foreign dictator   the American people won t let you get away with it.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 10, 2017"
" While Her Department Gets Gutted, Billionaire Betsy DeVos DEMANDS Extra Expensive Security","Donald Trump and his administration seem to be all about austerity, as long as it s the nation suffering and not his family or employees. Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos isn t suffering. In fact, she s the only cabinet member that requires security from not jut the Secret Service, but from US marshals, and it s costing the schools she oversees a lot of money.No one is telling us why DeVos needs the extra security, but the Marshalls are sending a bill to the Education Department in the amount of $8 million to cover about eight months. While that s a drop in the bucket for a department whose budget is about $70 billion, that money is coming straight from the nation s children s educations.The new outlay is a tiny fraction of the department s budget, but comes as the Trump administration has proposed slashing the spending plan by $9 billion, or 13.5 percent.DeVos is the only Cabinet secretary under the protection of the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses. They also guard the deputy attorney general and Supreme Court justices when they travel.Source: Washington PostDeVos s security team changed from Secret Service to the Marshalls after some protesters blocked her entry into a school shortly after her confirmation. The protest was completely non-violent. Other than that, we have no clue why the apparent overreaction.Note that DeVos is rich, very rich, even richer than her boss. She and her family are worth about $5.1 billion. If we can find a single rationale for putting the super rich in the higher eschelons of government, it should be that they could fray some of they cost, right?It seems, though, as if the super rich in government are now just taking their money making skills and using them to bilk the American taxpayers. Trump is making the taxpayers pay for a vacation a week and, now, DeVos s security is coming   literally   from the mouths and brains of children.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.

 This Reporter Just Won The Biggest Prize In Journalism For Exposing Trump’s Lies (DETAILS),"The winners of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize have been announced and this year s theme was all about exposing Trump.Of particular note was the prize for National Reporting going to David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post, whose contribution to reporting during the presidential campaign was to unflinchingly go after Trump s lies, particularly as they related to his contributions to charity.As the Pulitzer committee put it, Fahrenthold deserved the award:For persistent reporting that created a model for transparent journalism in political campaign coverage while casting doubt on Donald Trump s assertions of generosity toward charities.During a campaign when many reporters and pundits struggled to keep up with Trump s lies, or pretended Trump wasn t lying at all, Fahrenthold decided to hold Trump s feet to the fire. After Trump repeatedly dodged questions about his donations to charity, Fahrenthold compiled an exhaustive list of charities Trump was said to have given money to and painstakingly eliminated each one. In the end, the reporting showed that Trump was perhaps one of the least charitable rich people in the country. He also ran down individual anecdotes exposing Trump has a showboating opportunist who cynically exploited charity events for PR but avoided giving any money.In one example discovered by Fahrenthold, Trump stagecrashed an event meant to honor donors, stole the seat of a legitimate donor and then left before anyone knew what had just happened. Nobody knew he was coming,  said Abigail Disney, another donor sitting on the dais.  There s this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don t know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump. [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down. Trump was not a major donor. He was not a donor, period. He d never given a dollar to the nursery or the Association to Benefit Children, according to Gretchen Buchenholz, the charity s executive director then and now.It is for exposing stories like this and others that Fahrenthold has become reviled in the Trump White House and in conservative circles. He does what fearless journalism has always done: Speak truth to power.Hilariously, Farhrenthold isn t the only person to win the prestigious award for his coverage of Trump. Miami Herald cartoonist Jim Morin earned a Pulitzer for equally biting criticism of Trump. To highlight the point, his latest cartoon is a particularly brutal take down of Trump.Another loudmouth draft-dodging sanctimonious hypocrite phony patriot republican sending us to war #morintoon #TrumpSyria #ChemicalAttack pic.twitter.com/YHXtRaRff3  Jim Morin (@MorinToon) April 8, 2017And the New York Times took home the international reporting Pulitzer for coverage that also caused Trump no shortage of headaches. The paper exposed the rampant corruption and cruelty of the Putin regime in Russia. This made things extremely awkward for Trump. He, of course, benefited greatly from Putin s willingness to undermine democracy   specifically America s 2016 election. Trump has also praised the autocrat as a strong leader and at one time claimed him as a friend.It s extremely telling that so many of the top honors went to people who either directly or indirectly stood up to Trump s administration   whether it be clear-eyed reporting on the corruption from within the White House or the disastrous effects of the policies they and their allies in Congress have forced upon the country. In dark days, fearless critical reporting is more valuable than ever. And with Trump already threatening to crank up censorship laws, it s a rare and powerful commodity.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 What Republicans Are Doing To Stop People From Voting Is As Dirty As It Gets,"Let s face it, if it weren t for gerrymandering, Russian interference and straight up lies, Republicans would never hold another majority again and they d certainly never hold the presidency. Unfortunately, that s not our reality and Republicans in Iowa are so desperate that they are turning to lies to keep people from voting.Iowa s Secretary of State, Paul Pete, wants to pass stricter voting restrictions in an effort to keep undesirables (Democrats   especially Democrats of Color) from voting and he s lying to justify it.To substantiate his argument, Pate s office drafted a statement for a reporter from the local Gazette newspaper, noting that in Iowa it appeared 41 felons had cast ballots and that more than 200 election day voter registrations, or EDRs, had bounced back. The draft statement included the caveats that the irregularities  do not necessarily constitute fraud  and that the state would have a more complete picture of election data come March. Pate urged his staff to release it. We need to release info and these stats are public already. When an auditor turns them over to the county attorney or sheriff for action that pretty much makes it public. Am I missing something?,  he wrote in an email.Source: Huffington PostIn a state of three million people, 41 felons voting doesn t exactly seem like a reason to change voting laws for everyone, but even that paltry number is vastly misleading. According to Pate s deputy, Carol Olson: I do not believe that we should say that 41 felons illegally cast ballots. We encouraged them to use provisional ballots, so that would feel a little like we baited them to do something illegal,  she wrote.  And it s risky to label it  illegal  because we don t know the circumstances. It might be illegal, but [it] might not be, if someone really believed their rights were restored. We can report the number of felons voting, but let s not call it illegal,  she wrote.Olson noted that some of the statistics suggested something nefarious when it could simply be attributed to human error. I m also really reluctant to say that 207 EDR s (sic) from 15 counties bounced back. In the context of a discussion on election fraud, it sounds like we are suggesting that  bounce backs  are fraud or likely to be fraud,  she wrote.  First, it s only a partial report. What about the other 84 counties? How does this fit into the overall process of EDRs? The vast majority of these  bounce-backs  are sloppy addresses from voters in too much of a hurry when they register at the polls. That s a real reason to discourage EDR and a real reason to have pollbooks, but it s not an indicator of illegal activity. Regardless, it s likely the bill, that will require voter IDs, will pass, nearly ensuring that the state, which has long been a red-leaning swing state, will become a red state.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"April 10, 2017"
" Wife Of Arrested Russian Hacker Just Spoke Out, And Trump Is Shaking In His Boots","The wife of a Russian hacker who was arrested in Spain has spoken out, confirming that her husband, Pyotr Levashov, was (allegedly) involved in hacking our election. I asked for a warrant or some papers, they said they showed them to my husband,  Maria Levashova says.  With my husband, I talked to the commissariat by phone, he said that he was shown some piece of paper in Spanish without a seal and his photo in poor quality. Something was said about the fact that the virus my husband allegedly created was related to Trump s victory in the elections. Levashov, better recognized as  Peter Severa  and  Peter of the North  in hacking circles, is well-known in the cybercrime community. Krebs on Security reports:According to numerous stories here at KrebsOnSecurity, Levashov was better known as  Severa,  the hacker moniker used by a pivotal figure in many Russian-language cybercrime forums. Severa was the moderator for the spam subsection of multiple online communities, and in this role served as the virtual linchpin connecting virus writers with huge spam networks   including some that Severa allegedly created and sold himself.Levashov is currently listed as #7 in the the world s Top 10 Worst Spammers list maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus. The U.S. Justice Department maintains that Severa was the Russian partner of Alan Ralsky, a convicted American spammer who specialized in  pump-and-dump  spam schemes designed to artificially inflate the value of penny stocks.Levashov allegedly went by the aliases Peter Severa and Peter of the North (Pyotr is the Russian form of Peter). My reporting indicates that   in addition to spamming activities   Severa was responsible for running multiple criminal operations that paid virus writers and spammers to install  fake antivirus  software. So-called  fake AV  uses malware and/or programming tricks to bombard the victim with misleading alerts about security threats, hijacking the PC until its owner either pays for a license to the bogus security software or figures out how to remove the invasive program.There is ample evidence that Severa is the cybercriminal behind the Waledac spam botnet, a spam engine that for several years infected between 70,000 and 90,000 computers and was capable of sending approximately 1.5 billion spam messages a day.In 2010, Microsoft launched a combined technical and legal sneak attack on the Waledac botnet, successfully dismantling it. The company would later do the same to the Kelihos botnet, a global spam machine which shared a great deal of computer code with Waledac.The connection between Waledac/Kelihos and Severa is supported by data leaked in 2010 after hackers broke into the servers of pharmacy spam affiliate program SpamIt. According to the stolen SpamIt records, Severa   this time using the alias  Viktor Sergeevich Ivashov    brought in revenues of $438,000 and earned commissions of $145,000 spamming rogue online pharmacy sites over a 3-year period.Severa also was a moderator of Spamdot.biz (pictured in the first screenshot above), a vetted, members-only forum that at one time attracted almost daily visits from most of Russia s top spammers. Leaked Spamdot forum posts for Severa indicate that he hails from Saint Petersburg, Russia s second-largest city.Sevara is currently in custody in Barcelona, but is subject to an extradition request by the United States. Spanish news website El Confidencial also confirms that the arrest was related to hacking that helped Donald Trump  win  the election.With Trump screaming FAKE NEWS every time new facts come out about his collusion with Vladimir Putin to take the Oval Office by any means necessary   even if it does involve some Russian hackers, an aggressive propaganda campaign, and probably a couple Russian pee pee hookers   this news is not good for him. We can fully expect a meltdown on some sort on Twitter as soon as Breitbart reports on the arrest.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Trump Slapped With Lawsuit For Refusing To Release White House Visitor Logs,"Donald Trump is being sued   again. Three organizations have joined together to file suit against Mango Mussolini for his refusal to make White House visitor logs public.The National Security Archive, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University have all filed a suit against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Trump has ignored FOIA requests for the visitor logs and the suit is asking that the records be released. We hoped that the Trump administration would follow the precedent of the Obama administration and continue to release visitor logs, but unfortunately they have not,  CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. Given the many issues we have already seen in this White House with conflicts of interest, outside influence, and potential ethics violations, transparency is more important than ever, so we had no choice but to sue. The three groups suing Trump are asking not only that the visitor logs for the White House be released, but also that he make records public from Mar-a-Lago where he holds many of his meetings, particularly on weekends. Trump likes to use his resort to schmooze foreign leaders, most recently meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping there just last week.Tom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, said in a statement that the release of this information has been routine for many years. In September 2009, the Obama administration announced that they would release records of all visitors to the White House following multiple lawsuits that were filed by CREW. President Obama routinely released the data we re seeking with no damage to presidential privilege, and this information is central to the Secret Service mission and thus clearly agency records subject to FOIA,  Blanton said.According to another employee working for the National Security Archive, they were responsible for filing the first FOIA against the current administration just three days after Trump was sworn into office on January 23. When foreign officials go to see the president or his staff, the American people have a right to know who and when,  explained National Security Archive senior policy analyst Kate Doyle.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Racist Rep. Steve King Gives Trump DIRE Warning: Don’t Abandon White Supremacists (TWEET),"Congressman Steve King (R-IA) is pretty much the most openly racist person sitting in Congress. He recently came under fire for tweeting openly white supremacist sentiments about  western civilization  and not being able to restore it with  somebody else s babies.  Here is that awful tweet:Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017Now, he is giving Donald Trump a warning about sidelining white supremacist Steve Bannon in the White House in favor of more left-leaning advisers like Trump s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. This warning comes because word on the street is that there is a battle brewing between Bannon and Kushner, and it seems that Bannon is losing big time. In fact, Bannon may indeed be on his way out.Well, this is not sitting well with the white supremacists who have championed Trump so long and so hard, and indeed were instrumental in putting him into the White House. They even deliberately trended #FireKushner to send a message to Trump about where his priorities should lie. Rep. King chimed in with similar sentiments Sunday night, tweeting at Trump:@RealDonaldTrump Steve Bannon is the lynchpin to your energized base. Conservatives are an endangered species in your White House.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) April 10, 2017So, in other words, King is warning Trump that if he gives in to what the alt-right (read: white supremacists) call Ivanka and Jared s  globalist  leanings and policies, he s finished and his base will turn on him. This is probably true. However, the idea that Trump would pick Bannon in a showdown between the former Breitbart head and his daughter and son-in-law is downright laughable. So, suck it, Steve King. You won t be getting your way on this one.If the Bannon v. Kushner feud continues, Bannon will be pushed out, and there will be marginally more reasonable people who have Trump s ear. The side effect will be a betrayed and outraged alt-right and conservative base, which will ensure Donald Trump s defeat in 2020, along with his feuding with the Republicans on Capitol Hill who will surely not bow to his daughter and son-in-law s largely Democratic policies.So, bad for Republicans and Trump world, great for America.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Trump Is A MONSTROUS Threat To A Vital Government Function That Nobody Is Talking About,"When people talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses to the U.S., they generally talk about things like education, the environment, consumers, workers, immigrants, minorities, and so on. His  Make America Great Again  slogan is nothing more than hot air, and anybody who s been paying attention knows it. But there s one absolutely vital government function that Trump threatens that nobody s talking about. It s a safe bet that most of us actually haven t even thought of it, despite his warning to federal agencies to prepare for massive budget cuts.It s the U.S. Census. And the Census is something we need. Population counts determine the number of U.S. Representatives a state gets, and they also determine how the states  districts get redrawn. Even states with independent commissions depend on the Census to know how best to draw district lines.Census data is also used for federal programs affecting things like education, veterans  services, rural development, transportation, housing and more. The Census determines the allocation of funding for the following:And so much more, including in the private sector   businesses can use Census data to determine everything from optimal location to understanding both the local labor force and the local consumer population. Of course, most of this is stuff that the Trump administration and the Republican Party see as wastes anyway, but they ll be hard-pressed to actually cut funding for all of this in a budget without facing massive backlash.Hmm. Now that we re thinking about it, maybe sabotaging the Census would be their way of gutting all these programs.That list, while a ton, isn t all. There s also what Trump s stance on immigration could do. ICE has been sweeping cities for undocumented immigrants, even targeting courthouses as immigrants show up for hearings and appointments about pretty much everything. In fact, a judge in Washington State reported hearing that undocumented immigrants are missing court dates, even if they were seeking a protective order against an abuser.We have the growing hate and fear of Muslims to contend with, too   while they aren t being arrested and deported (yet), they could worry that answering the Census will expose sensitive information and make them more vulnerable to harassment and attack.For these reasons, immigrants and other minorities may find themselves far less willing to participate in the 2020 Census. And in communities that have high immigrant and/or minority populations, that could result in bad undercounts. Undercounts that are bad enough could result in districts, especially those that are done by independent commissions, being inadvertently redrawn in ways that don t accurately represent the states  populations.It could also result in impoverished, high-immigrant communities seeing necessary federal dollars drain away from programs they depend on.Now, okay, the Census is still three years away. But Trump s funding cuts have already forced them to scrap plans for some new field offices that would help the Census go more smoothly, and has also forced them to cancel the dry runs they do every decade in the run-up to the actual Census. That tells us that just conducting the 2020 Census is very likely to be problematic.They re asking us to do it online this year (partly as a cost-cutting measure, because of course), which raises cybersecurity concerns and could exacerbate immigrants  and minorities  fears of having ICE come knock at their door, or having asshat racists attack and/or harass them. Following hacks courtesy of everyone from Russia to the Shadow Brokers (who recently hacked the NSA), they re going to have one hell of a time convincing us that our data will be safe and secure.The problems Trump and the GOP are causing for the Census are nothing to shrug at. So much of the way this country is run depends on an accurate Census count, and they re going to have a really difficult time.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Alec Baldwin Makes Bombshell Announcement That’s Going To ENRAGE Trump,"If things keep going as they are, we may see a surprising candidate on the 2020 presidential ballot.

I would love to run for office because I think people need something different. I think that all the people that are on deck in 2020, none of them are going to win,  the 59-year-old actor   who plays Trump on  Saturday Night Live    told  Extra  in an interview released Tuesday.Without naming names, Baldwin reiterated,  None of those people are going to beat him. Source: The HillBaldwin s wife doesn t seem to be on board. During the interview, she shook her head and said,  we re not going to do that. Baldwin, though warned that if Trump were to be reelected, things would be a lot worse. You think things are bad now?  the performer added.  I ll tell you when things are going to be worse   if he wins again. Baldwin has been playing Trump for a while now, to popular acclaim. He performed both that role and the role of Bill O Reilly on Saturday Night Live on Saturday.Here s the video:That s not the same as actually being president, though, but the fact that Trump is in office could ironically be reason Baldwin might stand a chance.Baldwin is a popular liberal who has long been very vocal about politics, but he s no stranger to controversy. In 2013, he left a message for his daughter calling her a  rude thoughtless pig.  Last year, he called a reporter by a gay slur.In normal political times, Baldwin s lack of political experience, along with his caught-on-tape controversies, would be an immediate deal breaker, but these are not normal times. Baldwin s flaws are far less glaring than Trump s. Then again, Democrats are always held to a higher standard than Republicans.Featured image via D. Dipasupil/Getty Images. ",News,"April 9, 2017"
 Women In The World Founder Has The PERFECT Description For Trump’s Crazy Presidency (VIDEO),"This past week was the annual Women in the World Summit. It s a place that celebrates women who have a voice, and who speak for those who do not. It is a place of celebration, discussion, strategy, and empowerment. It is also a place for women to speak their minds. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton definitely spoke her mind on that stage. Now that the Summit is over, its founder, Tina Brown, is sounding off on Donald Trump s presidency.Appearing on CNN s Reliable Sources, Brown told host Brian Stelter of what it feels like to watch Trump: It s almost like being in the ward of a mental hospital half the time, with what s going on with Trump. I mean, you can t make this up. Stelter then asks,  You mean we re all the patients of the mental hospital? Brown responds: You know, watching his behavior, you know it s like watching out of control that s what makes it such riveting viewing. He seems so  his entire administration seems to be so out of control. Unfortunately it s addictive. Stelter then joked about a New Yorker cartoon that quipped about people  binge watching CNN,  and asked Brown if that was a bad thing. Brown responded: It s a disastrous thing, because, you know, you re actually talking about very serious things that are not being discussed, and that is what is so scary about it. I mean, I was thinking the other day, how many hours have been spent by everybody in Washington in the you know, last two months, whether it is the Intelligence community or the National Security community.. everybody trying to retrofit the crazy tweet about being eavesdropped by Obama. It s like the need to backfill his mendacity by so many different agencies is the most time-consuming thing right now in government. Stelter then lamented: It was a month ago, and we re never going to get that month back. Brown concluded: Think about all the things that weren t done in that month. Tina Brown is correct. It s like being in a mental hospital, or perhaps in the back of a car driven by a very drunk driver who thinks he is sober and refuses to stop so people who know better can hop out. The people who have the power to take us off this crazy train won t, so we re stuck. Hopefully, we survive.Watch the fascinating exchange below:Tina Brown:  It s almost like being in the ward of a mental hospital half the time, with what s going on with Trump  https://t.co/DH6Ywnnfni  Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) April 2, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 9, 2017"

This appears to be Trump s solution:The newest addition to Mar a Lago  a helipad and Trump chopper. pic.twitter.com/Hxb8QyR8Uu  Vivian Salama (@vmsalama) April 9, 2017Trump s administration claims the helipad was built to carry Trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic. They also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week. And like everything Trump does, the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby Trump s resort.When the proposal was first drawn up, it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area:Jesse H. Diner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Woodbridge Avenue resident Nancy deMoss, urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location. These are big helicopters, they re like flying tanks,  Diner said.DeMoss requires around-the-clock health care that has been impacted by Trump s weekend visits. Diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance, and she is uncomfortable with the U.S. Coast Guard boats sporting guns when Trump is in town.Trump went ahead with the plan anyway.Adding more absurdity, Trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend. The official Marine One, nor Trump, have used the helipad so far, but a giant helicopter with Trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot. Trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until Sunday   a shameless photo op attempt.It s also not clear whether Trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge Trump s golf obsession. The helipad was registered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation suggesting Trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s Mount Rushmore and not an excuse for Trump to take more vacations.If the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already $23 million Trump has spent taking vacations while president for just 11 weeks. At this rate, Trump is projected to eclipse Obama s entire cost of travel in just 10 months.It s for this reason that Trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  Southern White House  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president. It would be unsurprising to find that someday Trump renames the 18th hole at his Florida golf course after the Oval Office.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 9, 2017"
 O’Reilly And Trump Bond Over Sexual Harassment In Alec Baldwin’s Most Creative SNL Skit Yet (VIDEO),"We all love seeing Alec Baldwin portray Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, but last night he pulled another ace out of his sleeve when he debuted as Bill O Reilly. But it gets better   Baldwin s Bill O Reilly interviews Baldwin s Donald Trump!As the sketch opens, O Reilly addresses his audience on a serious note: Hello, I m Bill O Reilly, and I hope you are having a terrific evening, The subject of tonight s Talking Points Memo is a scandal everyone s been talking about all week. A scandal no one thought I would have the guts to address head on. It appears he s going to address his sexual harassment issues, but instead he reveals his true talking point: The shocking allegations of the abuse of power that have been leveled against the Obama administration. He then attempts to introduce Fox News reporter Laurie Dhue (one of the actual women who received a settlement after filing a sexual harassment suit). After he s told that she no longer works for Fox News, O Reilly asks,  Well, did she receive the check? After speaking to another female reporter who, for obvious reasons, had to stay 500 yards away from him, he goes on to address the issues he s having with sponsors leaving the show. As you know, 60 of our sponsors have pulled ads from the program,  O Reilly said, before going to commercial break.  No word as to why yet. We thank the following for sticking with us. After that, fake ads played for dog cocaine and horse Cialis. Now this is hard for me to discuss, but I also have been in the news this week,  Baldwin s O Reilly said after the break.  Several women have come forward and accused me of offering them exciting opportunities here at Fox News. Beyond that, the details are fuzzy, but one man was brave enough to come to my defense. A man who is unimpeachable on all female issues. Cue Donald Trump who did, in real life, come to O Reilly s defense this past week. The two then appear together in split screen. I actually see a lot of myself in you, Bill,  Baldwin s Trump said, calling himself a  big fan  of the host. O Reilly then thanks him for his support and asks him if he is actually familiar with the case. I m more familiar with this case than, say, health care, but I didn t really look into it much, no. I was busy being super presidential by bombing a bunch of shit. Baldwin s O Reilly then thanked him for promoting Sexual Assault Awareness Month and Trump said: That s right, Bill.

 Rep. Ted Lieu Issues Blistering Takedown Of Trump’s Illegal Missile Strike (VIDEO),"Anyone who knows anything about the separation of powers understands that a president cannot just unilaterally take military action. He needs approval from Congress to execute an act of war. However, since Donald Trump is president and he seems to think he is somehow above the law, he doesn t bother with silly little details like that. As a result, we got his launching of 59 Tomahawk missiles into a Syrian airfield. It turns out that quite a few people in Congress believe what Trump did to be potentially illegal. One such person is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA).Rep. Lieu is one of Trump s harshest critics and perhaps his most prolific Twitter troll. When it came to Trump s military action in Syria, Lieu did not mince words. Speaking with MSNBC s Katy Tur, Lieu said: Clearly, the president can take limited actions that the Congress has authorized such as going against terrorists who were involved with 9/11 or in terms of Iraq when Congress authorized the use of force in 2002, but there s been no congressional authorization to launch fifty-nine cruise missiles at a country that has not attacked us. Donald Trump s action last night was unconstitutional. He should not do it again. Rep. Lieu then went on to explain his problems with the launch and the dangers of taking such drastic action with no authorization and no clear strategy, after being asked if he would have authorized this action if he had been given the opportunity to do so: I might have if he would have articulated a strategy, and that is one of my fundamental problems with what he did. There has been no coherent strategy from the Trump administration. Last week, they signaled they were okay with Assad even though he had previously killed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and used chemical weapons. Last night, they attacked the Assad regime. We need to know what is the Trump administration thinking and what is their long-term strategy in Syria? Rep. Lieu is right. Trump s actions went against the Constitution. He cannot unilaterally make war. Further, he is clearly an erratic, impulsive man. Said erratic, impulsive man now has the power to destroy the world with one temper tantrum. Therefore, more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that Congress use its Article I powers to check and balance this dangerously unstable president.Watch Rep.

" Alec Baldwin Just Put Trump’s Idiot Supporters In Their Place, And It Was Beautiful (VIDEO)","Saturday Night Live returned with a stellar cold open that featured Alec Baldwin s Trump heading to Kentucky for a town hall with a bunch of   as  Trump  put it    people who don t just whisper  oh god what s happening after I leave the room. The sketch featured The Donald listening to the concerns of his voters on healthcare, drug rehabilitation, and environmental hazards then explaining to them one by one that he s getting right of all of them but the last one. And, of course, one by one, they expressed dismay that their Dear Leader would take away things they love (like medical care) but still threw their support behind him because Trump supporters are (as science tells us) not exactly the sharpest tool in a box containing a mixed metaphor. It s like you found a finger in your chili and you re still going to eat the chili because you told everyone how much you love chili,  Baldwin-Trump told his audience.This is probably the best insult that has ever been leveled at Trump s supporters by humankind. As Trump once said, he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and not lose a single voter. No matter what he does, who he hurts, or which prostitutes urinate on his hotel room bed, his people will stand behind him because they are exactly as proud as they are stupid   and they will never admit they made a mistake.Watch the cold open below: Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 9, 2017"
 Sean Penn TORE Steve Bannon To RIBBONS After Being Asked About About Working Together,"Sean Penn is not exactly one to mince words, and he didn t mince words when he was asked about the time he worked with Steve Bannon on a film project. Bannon has a heavy history of bankrolling and doing other work on films, even as recently as 2012. He was an executive producer for  The Indian Runner,  which was Penn s first time directing.Penn was not nice when talking about Bannon, and that s putting it mildly. He actually said: Bannon was then, as he is now, simply another bitter Hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm. But, deep in his heart, he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind. And then there are also the bad things about him And then there are also the bad things about him  Wow. Just wow. We ve known since Bannon came into the spotlight a year ago that he was a complete dick who loves bullying people. Earlier this year, film critic Ann Hornaday wrote a piece for the Washington Post that talks about what we can learn about Bannon from watching the films he made.Many of his films are directly tied to his worldview   in fact, he s an extreme right-wing version of Michael Moore in that respect. He s spent a lot of time attacking  the permanent political class,  in his films, along with  hippies and community organizers  who allegedly hate this country and hate the Constitution. He s gone after Hillary Clinton and President Obama, but also Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. In short, he hates the whole world and everyone in it who doesn t see it exactly the way he does.Which seems to be exactly what Penn was describing in his mini-diatribe.Bannon is also someone who issues threats and ultimatums and strong-arms people into doing things his way. His narcissistic ego likely suffered a massive blow when he tried to bully Republicans on their farce of a healthcare bill by saying,  This is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill. Even before that sorry excuse of a bill failed, just the idea of Republicans not following his orders was enough for him to urge Trump to create a  shit list.  When Republicans scoffed in his general direction over his  orders,  it was very likely a humiliating defeat for him.So  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind,  is a damned accurate description of him.Image of Sean Penn by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for The Hollywood Reporter.

 BREAKING: This New Analysis BAD News For Obamacare Haters (DETAILS),"Paul Ryan is all over Twitter chanting  repeal and replace,  and proclaiming the ACA a disaster. Trump has said repeatedly that it s going to explode (and it ll be on the Democrats  heads when it does). They re all spewing dire warnings about insurers leaving the marketplace in 2018, and yet, they still don t have a plan, which is a worse failure than anything since they had seven years to do it. And unfortunately for them, there s a new analysis out that points to something besides their dire predictions.Standard & Poor s took a look at the performance of many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across nearly 36 states, and found that the insurers under Blue Cross Blue Shield actually reduced their losses in 2016, will probably break even this year, and will start seeing a profit from the marketplace in 2018.S&P bluntly gives the lie to the GOP s cries of  death spirals  with this:After years in which many insurers lost money, then lost even more in 2015,  we are seeing the first signs in 2016 that this market could be manageable for most health insurers,  the Standard & Poor s analysts said. The  market is not in a  death spiral. A majority of Americans want Congress to fix the ACA, not  repeal and replace  it anymore. Their sorry attempt at passing a healthcare bill last month further damaged their already-destroyed credibility on the issue, and nearly 70 percent of Americans want to keep the parts of the ACA that are working, and fix the parts that aren t working so well.Also, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report, 33 percent of Americans say that Republicans are responsible for the failure of their farce of a healthcare plan, and another 28 percent say Trump is responsible. Only 25 percent of those surveyed blame Democrats for the bill s failure.It s true that insurers are threatening to pull out of the ACA s marketplace, which will leave some places with only one carrier or without any at all in the marketplace. That s something that could have been changed or prevented if the GOP had actually managed to get something together over the last seven years.Depending on what happens this year, though, that could change. If it does, then Republicans will be out of excuses.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 9, 2017"
" Former GOP Rep. Thinks Adam Schiff Should Recuse Himself From Russia Probe Too, Because Reasons","Earlier this week, Devin Nunes finally recused himself from the House Intel Committee s probe on Russian election tampering, putting Mike Conaway of Texas in charge. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, remains in place. Schiff has been working tirelessly to ensure that Nunes  decision to leak classified info, and to talk to Agent Cheeto before the rest of his committee, doesn t derail the House s investigation any more than it has to.But some Republicans are apparently unhappy with Schiff still being there. One such Republican is former House Intel Chairman Mike Rogers, who seems to think that if Nunes had to recuse himself from the probe, then Schiff should likewise recuse himself. His reasoning is almost as batty as Mike Conaway s reasoning that Mexican performing artists are the same as Russian hackers: Representative Adam Schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe. For his part, Schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on Russia-Trump campaign ties that was  the kind of evidence  that would be presented to a grand jury, adding that he had seen additional evidence, but not elaborating further. He went on to ask how the committee could continue doing its business when secret information is publicly discussed, even by innuendo. Except Schiff didn t go running to others with documents in hand. He simply explained how he interpreted what he had seen, without revealing what he had seen.Republicans seem to be incapable of making valid comparisons.Rogers has a serious problem with Schiff because he believes that Schiff politicized the committee s investigation. He couldn t be more wrong. It was Nunes who politicized it when he took information directly to Trump before presenting it to the rest of the committee.Rogers is right about one thing: The committee needs to get back on track as soon as possible. That won t happen without Schiff, though, because he s been relentless in trying to keep the committee on track. Rogers  call for him to recuse himself positively reeks of,  No fair!

 Paul Ryan Makes PERFECT Argument For Medicare For All; Dumbass Didn’t Even Realize (TWEETS),"Sometimes you just need to let people talk and they ll eventually say what you have been saying the whole time. Albeit, it may be accidental. And in this case, liberals should take what they can get when it comes to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) giving a the perfect argument for Medicare for all. They should also not let him forget it.While trying to make the Affordable Care Act look bad, Ryan accidentally made the perfect argument for Medicare for all.Ryan tweeted out: With another insurer leaving the Iowa insurance market, more Americans will be left without a choice when it comes to their health care. With another insurer leaving the Iowa insurance market, more Americans will be left without a choice when it comes to their health care. https://t.co/4agdcFoqLz  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) April 8, 2017Then follows it up with this: Five Iowa counties will now be left with just two health insurers, while the rest will only have one option. This is unacceptable. Five Iowa counties will now be left with just two health insurers, while the rest will only have one option. This is unacceptable.  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) April 8, 2017Now, first of all, if Iowa had set up Obamacare properly, they d have their own health exchange and not put you to the national website. This would have also subsequently given Iowa insurers the ability to work directly with the state. Secondly, when for-profit companies are given the ability to mess with people s care for the sake of profit and to try to prove a point that something  isn t working  they will do so.Thus, when all is said and done, this is the perfect argument for Medicare for all, OR at least a public option. A public option would provide a guaranteed option for citizens of any state, as well as provide competition in the for-profit world of health insurance, which would then drive down costs across the board (yay, true capitalism and not a manipulative market!). Medicare for all would be ideal, yet not as realistic at the moment, and would provide care to every single American. Imagine that! Taxes being used for tax payers!When all is said and done, we can thank Paul Ryan for this perfect meme to use against him time and time again.

 Images Of Trump Golfing In Florida Leak Despite Him Ordering Press Pool To Stay Inside,"Trump s war on  leakers  who make him look bad by exposing his lies is about to escalate. On Saturday, a CNN reporter managed to snap a few pictures of Trump playing golf for the 15th time as president, despite efforts by his staff to stop it. No doubt, the reporter will face recriminations from the Trump team for doing his job.This is the state our nation has been reduced to: A president so committed to vacations in the face of dismal approval ratings that he locks his press pool up to avoid getting caught doing what he knows looks really, really bad. When they report on it, they get attacked.President Trump playing a round of golf Saturday at his club in West Palm Beach pic.twitter.com/aJ4utIM8po  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) April 8, 2017The photo is blurry and obscured because Trump did not want to be photographed and took all steps to avoid it.

On other occasions, Trump s staff has gone to absurd lengths to prevent them from getting any pictures of Trump while he s golfing. At one point, they began taping garbage bags over windows in the rooms reporters were held so they couldn t see outside.

Several weeks in a row, Trump claimed he was in serious  meetings  only to later be photographed golfing. In a baffling move that makes one wonder if he wants to be caught, Trump apparently wears the exact same outfit every time he golfs.

He just can t stop golfing. Each time he does, he opens himself up to relentless criticism. It s his 15th vacation in 11 weeks. He s spent $23 million in travel expenses. He s golfing while his own White House implodes. But rather than just, say, skip a weekend of golf, he keeps going back.That s a particularly disturbing pathology in a man who wants us to believe he s an effective president.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Dummy-In-Chief Requests Fewer Words And More Pictures Be Used In Intelligence Briefings,"While on the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump told his supporters at a rally in South Carolina, I m very highly educated. I know words, I know the best words. But there s no better word than stupid.  Trump was referring to President Barack Obama as  stupid.  However, Obama will be looked back fondly in history as probably one of our greatest presidents, a great orator who inspired the masses, and Trump will not.In January, Trump began receiving his intelligence briefings and his team made a request for fewer words to be used and instead, to use more pictures.The Washington Post reports:The president, they said, was a visual and auditory learner. Would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures?Similarly, after Trump entered office, his staff took President Barack Obama s Syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into more-digestible bites, complete with photos, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the request.According to senior administration officials and members of Congress who spoke with Trump, it was the image of young, listless children being splashed with water in a frantic attempt to cleanse them of the nerve agent and another one of an anguished father holding his twin babies, swathed in soft white fabric, poisoned to death, that prompted the alleged president to take action after watching cable news.Trump allegedly told his senior staff that the images and footage of what was taking place in Syria was  horrible  and  awful. We can agree that it is, however, it s more likely that Trump is using this as a distraction. After all, this widely circulated photograph of Alan Kurdi, a young refugee child who drowned to death, apparently never disturbed Donald Trump.Trump was also opposed to Obama s attempt to strike Syria when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than 1,400 dead outside of Damascus in 2013. There were images of children who were victims of that gas attack were reported online and on the news, too.Quick question: Ever since Trump ordered a strike on Syria, how much of the news cycle has covered his administration s ties to Russia? Or his conflicts of interest, etc, etc, etc.Image of Alan Kurdi via Wikipedia. Image of the amateur president: screen capture via Trump Draws on Twitter.",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Everyone KNEW Trump Would Be Golfing Again – So Protesters Were Totally Ready When He Showed Up,"There are only three things for certain in this world: Death, taxes, and Trump golfing every weekend. Today featured all three in a way.Two days ago, Trump spent around $90 million in tax dollars to bomb an empty airbase in Syria. The symbolic attack did little to stop the Syrian government s ability to bomb its citizens   bombers were reportedly back to using the airstrip just hours later   but it had the effect of inflaming already high tensions between the United States and supporters of the Syrian regime in Russia and Iran.So covering death and taxes, Trump moved onto golf.The fact that he would go on vacation just days after creating an international crisis was so painfully obvious that protesters planned for it. When Trump s motorcade was spotted on route to his golf course in Florida, the signs came out to greet him. According to reporters riding with Trump, the stuff Trump saw should put to rest any notion that he isn t aware that much of the country despises him.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017It s not clear yet whether Trump plans to lie about his golf outing as he s done in previous weeks. By a rough count, Trump has golfed around 15 times since becoming president 11 weeks ago. Many of those vacations were done in secret, with his staff covering for him with claims that he was in  meetings.  Inevitably, pictures of Trump in golf attire hitting the links turn up online exposing just how shameless this administration is.The fact that protesters can be so certain that Trump will be golfing   even after committing America to a possible war in Syria   is incredibly disheartening. You can plan your day around the assumption that the most powerful person in the country will be slipping into golfing shoes every single weekend. Hilariously, this criticism was most clearly leveled by one of Trump s biggest defenders: Sean Hannity.In 2013, Hannity hypocritically slammed Obama of playing golf during the Syrian civil war.The war in Syria rages on but so far Hannity hasn t complained about any one of Trump s 15 golf outings. Odd. And further undermining Hannity s complaint: Trump has spent so much time golfing that he s now spent a quarter of Obama s total cost in travel expenses in just his first 11 weeks. By the end of his first year, he will have cost the American taxpayer over $100 million.Report: Obama's travel expenses were $97m over eight years.

" Dan Rather Condemns Trump’s Reality Show Tactics In Syria, RIPS Media For Calling Act ‘Presidential’","Unless you ve been living under a rock for the past few days, you now know that our idiot wannabe  president  just used military resources and spent god knows how many millions of taxpayer dollars just to put on a little show in Syria that, instead of making him look good, embarrassed America and pissed off most of the world. It might even have pissed off Russia, though we re still of the belief that Putin was in on this whole scheme.Before Trump fake-attacked Syria late Thursday night, he warned his BFF Putin, who in turn, warned his allies in Syria, who then evacuated the base and surrounding areas. Sadly, 16 innocent civilians were killed in this needless, unforgivable display. Among them, women and children from a local village. The SAME women and children that he stood at his podium Thursday, chest puffed out, promising to protect. Sorry, asshole   your little publicity stunt backfired and you will have to answer for that one day   the sooner the better.What makes this whole f*cked up situation even more disgusting is that journalists all over have been ignoring the obvious   Trump did this as a distraction from investigations into his collusion with Russia and to gain support to boost his record low poll numbers   and they are actually praising him for this act! One of these journalists, shockingly, was CNN host Fareed Zakaria who went on CNN s New Day and said the unthinkable: I think Donald Trump became president of the United States last night. I think this was actually a big moment. After watching his fellow journalists essentially roll over and cave to whatever mystical powers Trump seems to have over the people who support him, one famed and beloved journalist wasn t having it. Dan Rather took to Facebook Friday with a scathing post that ripped those journalists, and especially Donald Trump, to shreds. To Trump, he had this to say:The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief. It is an awesome responsibility. Committing the use of force and American men and women in uniform is about as serious as it gets. But the truly great presidents understand that knowing when NOT to act is as important as knowing when to act.It is a whole lot easier starting wars than finishing them. And there are many historical examples of where a promise of limited engagement quickly metastasized into something much bigger.There is a tendency to rally around the flag, and a president who takes on a war footing can see a boost of support. It is often transitory. There are arguments to be made that President Assad in Syria has crossed a line that demands U.S. military interference. Whether this should have been a unilateral action is something we all must consider. Whether President Trump has a plan for what comes next must be debated. Whether there is a coherence to this missile strike fitting into a larger foreign policy strategy is a question that should give us all pause.He goes on to slay the media and puts them in their place, reminding them that it is their job to ask hard questions. Rather says:There is ample evidence that this Administration needs to face deep scrutiny. The lies we have heard, the chaos in governance, and the looming questions about ties with Russia   itself a major player in Syria   demand that the press treat this latest action with healthy skepticism.He concludes his post with a dire warning that we should all pay very close attention to:The number of members of the press who have lauded the actions last night as  presidential  is concerning. War must never be considered a public relations operation. It is not a way for an administration to gain a narrative. It is a step into a dangerous unknown and its full impact is impossible to predict, especially in the immediate wake of the first strike.What will happen next remains unknown, but one thing is for certain   we can t forget our principles and cave to this monster, no matter how bright and shiny he makes the future sound. He s a liar, a sexual predator, most likely a criminal, and he s most certainly a con artist whose only real public experience was having a reality television show with a famous tagline. That is all he is. Don t forget that.But, we should always keep hope alive that one day soon we will get to say to him,  You re FIRED!  That will be a glorious day!You can read Dan Rather s heartfelt post in its entirety here.Featured image via Getty/Kirk Irwin",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Bill O’Reilly’s Show Bizarrely Cut Short In Wake Of Advertisers’ Mass Exodus (DETAILS),"The New York Times recently published a bombshell story about the culture of sexual harassment at Fox News, and their star host, Bill O Reilly, is at the center of it. The Times story says that O Reilly and Fox News paid five women more than $13 million in hush money who accused O Reilly of sexually harassing them. As a result, more than 50 important advertisers have pulled out of advertising their goods on The O Reilly Factor.In fact, so many ads have been pulled that Thursday s show included almost no ads at all, and certainly none from nationally recognized brands. Seemingly, as a result of all of these companies running as far and fast as they can from the public relations nightmare that is Bill O Reilly, the Thursday night edition of O Reilly s show was bizarrely cut short.There was no explanation for the abrupt ending to O Reilly s broadcast. The show usually lasts an hour, but was only on for 45 minutes. Throughout the show, O Reilly had kept promising a funny segment with Jesse Waters, who usually goes out and talks to people on the street in a mean-spirited segment meant to embarrass people and make them look bad on the air. That segment never came.Instead of the Waters segment, at the end of O Reilly s strangely short show, fellow Fox anchor Shep Smith spent the extra 15 minutes reporting on the goings on in Syria. This was prior to the world knowing that Trump had launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian airfield in response to the chemical weapons attack, so it s not like this was any sort of breaking news segment.When O Reilly s extra 15 minutes was up, Smith s time ended, and Tucker Carlson s show started right on cue, with no mention of what happened to O Reilly, and no explanation.Hopefully, this is a sign that Bill O Reilly is on his way out at Fox, and his toxic message will poison the airwaves no more.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Federal Judge Just Gave Attorney General Jeff Sessions A Huge F*ck You,"A federal judge just proudly gave Jeff Sessions the middle finger by approving Baltimore s police reforms even after the attorney general had voiced his opposition.The Justice Department began investigating the Baltimore Police Department in 2014 after news reports that they had paid out millions to settle upwards of 100 lawsuits over police brutality and misconduct. Following the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, the investigation intensified. The DOJ, which was still under former President Obama at the time, found widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory practices.Mother Jones reports:  Earlier this week, Sessions ordered a review of all consent decrees between police departments and the Justice Department. Department lawyers asked the US district court in Baltimore to put off approving the consent decree for at least 30 days so the new administration could review it. I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city,  Sessions said in a scathing statement.  Make no mistake, Baltimore is facing a violent crime crisis. On Friday, US District Judge James Bredar told Sessions to go to hell, informing him that  the time for negotiating the agreement is over. The case is no longer in a phase where any party is unilaterally entitled to reconsider the terms of the settlement; the parties are bound to each other by their prior agreement,  Bredar wrote.  The time for negotiating the agreement is over. The only question now is whether the Court needs more time to consider the proposed decree. It does not. According to Sessions, the agreement was put together in a rush at the very end of Obama s presidency and it looks like he is right. The final report was issued last summer but after Trump was elected, officials reportedly scrambled to get everything finalized, and for good reason. Because they managed to complete this particular task before Obama left office, Sessions  hands are now tied.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syria Is EXACTLY What Noam Chomsky Warned Us About A Week Ago,"Donald Trump decided to bomb Syria on Wednesday in response to a chemical attack on the Syrian people. Watching the new reports, I couldn t help but think of an article I wrote just last week about a warning from Noam Chomsky that now looks like more of a prediction.In an interview with Alternet, Chomsky said that if Trump s approval ratings continue to plummet we should be ready for  the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act, which can change the country instantly. To be clear, by  staged or alleged terrorist attack,  Chomsky doesn t necessarily mean fake. Speaking to Truthout just days later, the noted scholar explained that Trump could simply take advantage of the situation should an attack occur and  exploit it. If that happens, we can expect that the Trump-Bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to American security (or if there is one, exploiting it). Or, perhaps, scapegoating the most vulnerable: immigrants, Muslims, welfare recipients (one of Reagan s disgusting techniques), and other available targets,  Chomsky explained.  That could turn very ugly. It could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist Bertram Gross predicted 30 years ago. Or worse. And then comes Syria. While we are still sorting out all the details, one thing is for certain: Trump doesn t give a damn about Syrian babies. If he was worried about these people, he wouldn t have tried repeatedly to stop all Syrian refugees from entering the country as part of his bigoted Muslim ban.So, if Trump didn t decide to bomb Syria because he was  heartbroken and outraged  over the deaths of these  beautiful babies,  why would he do it? Simple. Chomsky already answered this question. He did it because nothing galvanizes a country and boosts approval ratings like a war. And it s working.Naturally, Trump s supporters think bombing Syria was the greatest way ever to show the world who has the biggest   ahem   hands. But even Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are backing the move. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have both staunchly opposed Trump since the very beginning, are applauding Trump s retaliation against Assad as well.Trump s actions in Syria also provide another golden opportunity. Trump and Russia get to pretend they re mad at each other. And, of course, that will totally prove that they weren t colluding to steal the presidential election.It is also worth noting that Trump s airstrikes were largely a publicity stunt. Trump warned Russia of the impending attack about an hour before the first bombs started flying. And according to ABC, Russia warned Assad. As a result, most of the equipment and personnel held at the target air base were gone by the time the assault actually began.This is exactly what Chomsky warned us about a week ago. Trump looked at the atrocities taking place in Syria and saw a way to boost his popularity because he s desperate. It s all so transparent, it s sickening.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Person Majority Of Americans Voted For SHREDS Incompetent Fool Over Syria Actions (VIDEO),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump has absolutely no idea what he is doing in regards to policy both domestic and foreign. He s a blundering fool who belongs nowhere near the Oval Office, and maybe he knows this considering how much time he spends away from it at his resorts.While many are commenting on the order given by Trump to deliver airstrikes on a Syrian airbase, one person who knows probably more than anyone about geopolitics weighed in with their opinion. That person is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Clinton actually agreed that action needed to be taken and hours before Trump gave the order, she suggested hitting Syrian airfields. She said: I really believe that we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them. However, Trump s strikes were ineffective at stopping anything, and unlike the *president, Clinton actually knows that a plan of follow up action needs to take place. She also knows that Trump can t say he cares about the slaughter of innocent children, but then also deny them refuge in the United States. It s hypocritical, to say the least.While speaking at the Women in the World conference in Texas, Clinton said: I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values   And I also hope that they will recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close America s doors to them. And she is absolutely correct. Trump s move in Syria was purely symbolic. It was posturing and it did nothing but provide a different narrative for the news to talk about other than Russia helping Trump get elected.It s going to be up to Trump to move forward with an actual plan of action with Syria, but don t hold your breath.Watch Hillary Clinton show what true leadership looks like here:Hillary Clinton: US cannot, in one breath, speak of protecting Syrian babies and close America s doors to them https://t.co/QLRmvvoVHv pic.twitter.com/FPNms0NBkQ  CNN (@CNN) April 7, 2017Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syrian Air Base Trump Spent $80 Million Attacking Yesterday Already Up And On Bombing Raids Again,"The Syrian air base Trump spent $80 million bombing yesterday is reportedly back in business. It s been less than 24 hours.According to Syrian human rights observers, warplanes were seen using the airbase as part of their attacks on anti-government forces near Homs.Reuters:Syrian warplanes took off from an air base which was hit by U.S. cruise missiles on Friday, and carried out air strikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern Homs countryside, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Trump received praise from right-wing politicians and media pundits giddy at the idea of another war for his  decisive  blow to the Syrian regime. Instead, it appears the attack did very little to undermine Assad s military.It did, however, escalate tensions in the region and inflame military posturing from Iran and Russia. According to Russian officials, the country will begin shipping anti-aircraft weapons into Syria in direct response to Trump s attack. A Russian war ship has also positioned itself near the two U.S. vessels responsible for firing the tomahawk missiles into Syria.Trump s attack on the Syrian air base had a staggering price tag. The guy who claimed America couldn t afford to pay for Meals on Wheels spent an estimated $60-80 million on the rockets alone. The entire cost for the military action is likely much higher.The attack itself was largely an empty gesture   provocative but meaningless. Trump warned Russia ahead of time (in order to allow Russian soldiers to leave the battlefield). The Russians tipped off the Syrians, who also evacuated before the first missile touched down. One estimate put the death toll at eight. It s not entirely clear if the real number is even that high.As for Trump, his motivation seemed clear: Publicity. A few years ago, Trump even hinted that this might be his response to sagging approval numbers when he projected his own insecurities onto then president Obama.Now that Obama s poll numbers are in tailspin   watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2012Trump, desperate and angry, suddenly thinks attacking Syria is an important military action.

 Syria Strike Completely Backfires Against Trump; Even His Hard Core Supporters Are DONE,"In case you just woke up, the United States is now at war with Syria. It was waged without congressional approval and by a man who ran on a platform of isolationism. Now, his isolationist followers are pissed.It doesn t help that the favorite conspiracy theorist of Trump and his followers called the Assad attack on his own people a  false flag  designed to take us to war. According to his followers, Trump fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Or, he was lying to them all along.The Trump of weeks past was firmly against any action in Syria. He even accused President Obama of wanting to wage war in Syria over falling poll numbers. Now that Trump s poll numbers are in a complete tailspin, he desperately attacked Syria.Now that Obama s poll numbers are in tailspin   watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2012He also said that Obama would have had to get congressional approval.

 The White House Just Confessed The REAL Reason For Syria Attack; It Is DISGUSTING (DETAILS),"While many have been baffled and upset by Donald Trump s reckless decision to attack Syria (without Congressional approval), the inner details of what drove Trump to make such a decision are even worse.Senior White House officials have just confessed that this attack against Syria was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Trump, to feed his out of control ego. According to those officials, the poorly planned missile strike (which ultimately failed) isn t even part of a broader strategy or a step in a larger plan to remove Assad. It was absolutely meaningless, and its only purpose was to make Trump seem like a strong leader.CNN s Jim Acosta reported:While it s not surprising that Trump has no strategy for Syria (let s face it, he has zero strategy for anything he does), it s terrifying to actually see it play out before our eyes as an incompetent president puts America in grave danger.Basically, Trump used the U.S. military to make it LOOK like he was taking some sort of action on Syria, when really the exact opposite is true. There is no plan, and there likely will never be one. What Trump put on last night was merely a performance   and a damaging one. Already, U.S.-Russia relations have grown more tense as Russia is making moves to punish America for Trump s carelessness.The message Trump is sending to the world is terrifying   what we can expect during Trump s presidency is a show; just big empty gestures that won t actually carry any weight. Trump has basically shown Assad that he s not really going to do anything besides send 50 missiles his way. Now Assad   and the rest of the world   knows our president is all talk and almost no action. The strength and leadership that America once had in the world is disintegrating quickly.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syrian Military Knew Missile Attack Was Coming After Trump Told Putin About It,"Donald Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin seems to be going the way of most middle school  relationships.  Though the Russian dictator was perfectly happy to employ a team of hackers to dig into The Donald s opponents at his request and propagandists to spread fake stories about his opponents, Mr. 45 s attack on Syria was too much for the guy who is known for killing unfriendly journalists and political opponents.CNN reported that Trump s team called Russia to warn them of the airstrike in advance   and according to ABC, the Syrian army seemed to know the attack was coming, allowing them to evacuate equipment and personnel:Syrian military officials appeared to anticipate Thursday night s raid on Syria s Shayrat air base, evacuating personnel and moving equipment ahead of the strike, according to an eyewitness.Dozens of Tomahawk missiles struck the air base near Homs, damaging runways, towers and traffic control buildings, a local resident and human rights activist living near the air base told ABC News via an interpreter.Let s look at what happened here: Trump warned Putin of an attack because his people were in the area. Mysteriously, the targets learned of the incoming Tomahawk missiles and were able to evacuate people and equipment.Interesting, eh?Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Trump Tried Recreating Obama’s Iconic ‘Bin Laden Raid’ Situation Room Photo – And It’s So Pathetic,"For months now people close to Trump have been privately saying the president is consumed by a seething jealousy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Where Trump s approval ratings continue to circle the drain, Obama s have seen a post-presidency surge. Adding to that, Obama s signature piece of legislation is not only more popular than ever, but the replacement Trump came up with imploded before it even got a vote. In the media and from political observers Obama is viewed as smarter, more mature, and more gifted politically than Trump. And Trump knows it.So what is Trump to do? Imitate.Hours after he ordered a missile strike in Syria, Trump s press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted an image of the situation room.WH photo (ed for security): @potus receives briefing on #syria military strike fr Nat Security team, inc @vp , SECDEF, CJCS via secure VTC pic.twitter.com/aaCnR7xomR  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017It bore a disturbing resemblance to one of the most famous photographs of Obama s time in office, the night he ordered the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.However, unlike Obama s image   filled with serious people doing serious jobs   Trump s version contains a number of unqualified goons. The photograph of Obama and his staff signaled strength. Trump s imitation serves only to show the world what a clown show Trump s White House is.Trump s attack on Syria may have earned praise by right-wingers, but it s already escalating tensions in the region and may someday be viewed as the opening shot in a devastating global war. Russia, rather than cave to Trump s show of  strength  has vowed to arm the Syrian regime with more anti-aircraft weapons meant to shoot down any U.S. plane that crosses the border.BREAKING Russian military says it will help Syria strengthen its air defenses after US strike.  The Associated Press (@AP) April 7, 2017The attack also alienated Iran, pushing them further into the sphere of Russia and the Assad government.Those are some serious consequences for actions being made by Rex Tillerson, a former oil executive with ties to Russia; Steve Bannon, the owner of white nationalist website Breitbart; and Jared Kushner, the son of a real estate mogul who married the daughter of a real estate mogul. The fact that those men are even in the room is a disgrace to America s military, who will likely carry the brunt of the consequences.But perhaps the biggest joke in the room is that Donald Trump himself.

 Weird: Republicans Were Against Obama Launching A Strike On Syria But Not Now (DETAILS),"A U.S. official said that the Russians were warned before the U.S. launched at least 59 tomahawk missiles aimed at Syria at Donald Trump s orders, but the alleged president did not seek Congressional approval. Trump was reportedly affected by the pictures of children who were harmed or killed after a deadly gas was unleashed on civilians, but oddly, the former reality show star was never disturbed by the pictures of Syrian refugees fleeing from terror at the hands of ISIS.Trump was not in The Situation Room when addressing the strikes. He was at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort again. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,  Trump said of the chemical attack.  It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. However, Trump opposed President Barack Obama s attempt to strike when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than 1,400 dead outside of Damascus in 2013.Trump tweeted at the time,  What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval. What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013In contrast to Trump s move on Syria last night, Obama went to Congress to get approval to strike, but the majority of Republicans opposed him. In the newest attack under Trump s administration, 70 died from the gas attack. Again, over 1,400 were left dead in 2013.ThinkProgress reported at the time that 183 Republicans were against bombing Syria. Only 12 Republicans, and that includes then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), sided with the Obama to launch a strike. In the end, Obama decided to postpone the vote since Congress was strongly opposed to the strike with 243 Congressional members seemingly deciding  towards voting  No. The Huffington Post reports:Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) was one of the members of Congress who was against Obama s plan. But he didn t seem to have much to say in response to the news of Trump s strike. God bless the USA!,  Chaffetz tweeted.God bless the USA!  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) April 7, 2017Weird, because before an attack, other religious extremists would shout,  Allahu Akbar!

His children, Ivanka included, tend to either follow him or walk in lockstep with him on virtually everything.

 WATCH: Colbert’s Takedown Of ‘Cuck’ Steve Bannon Is Nothing Short Of BRILLIANT,"By now, everyone knows that the Jared Kushner vs. Stephen K. Bannon infighting in the White House is coming to a head. It has resulted in the removal of Bannon from the National Security Council. Apparently, Kushner had a hand in getting Bannon s hands off our national security, so, for this one, go Jared. We now have a much more secure nation, thanks to his removal. One person who couldn t wait to mock the white nationalist s takedown by his own was Late Show host Stephen Colbert.Colbert started that part of his monologue by mocking Bannon s resistance to being taken off the NSC, saying: Today we re learning more about a huge event yesterday when Steve Bannon was removed from the National Security Council. It s so nice to have Bannon fans here to night. They re so rare, so rare. It was not easy to remove Bannon. They held a hot match to his back until he released his pincers. And, they think the head might still be in there. He might get an infection. Colbert then went on to express disbelief that this was not a demotion: I m not sure if he accomplished his goal. There are still some Muslims in America. There s still some, right? Can you check on that? Still a couple.Word on the street is that Jared Kushner helped push Bannon out. How many jobs does that kid have? I m not sure I m surprised by this. I m not surprised at all in fact, because there is known friction between these two.Whenever Kushner s not around, Bannon calls him a  cuck.  And Bannon tried to stop the demotion, threatening at one point to quit if it went forward. Wait, wait a second, Steve Bannon, you threatened to quit if you got kicked off the National Security Council? Then you got kicked off and you didn t quit? That s a TCM, bro! TOTAL CUCK MOVE! This is absolutely brilliant. There is so much goodness in that clip, that it has to be watched repeatedly to be fully appreciated.Watch below via The Late Show Twitter:Tonight: Steve Bannon, forced off the NSC by White House rival Jared Kushner, commits what some are calling a 'TCM.' #LSSC #TCM pic.twitter.com/AllTUQt2aI  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 7, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 7, 2017"
 BREAKING: C.I.A. Knew Russia Wanted Trump WAY Before Election; NOTHING Was Done (DETAILS),"We already knew that Russia wanted Donald Trump to be president and interfered with the election, but new information has just been revealed showing that not only was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aware of this, but they were in the know as early as August of 2016. That s well before anything was revealed to the public.According to the New York Times: The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump s victory months later, former government officials say. Further: The former officials said that in late August   10 weeks before the election   John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break.It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the final weeks of the campaign, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. Then there s this: The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. So, not only did Russia work to get Trump elected, but those closely connected to Trump may have been working directly with Russia.Here s the thing   if this information was available before the election, and it was well known that not only was Russia trying to influence the election, but Trump advisers may have been talking directly to Russia, why was the election allowed to even go forward? For all intents and purposes, the election should be considered absolutely illegitimate and a new election should be held in light of all this new information.Our democracy and the core of everything we are as a republic has been compromised by a foreign adversary, and NOTHING has been done. This is NOT okay.The public had a right to know this information going into the voting booth, and nothing was said. This is beyond maddening, and someone needs to be held responsible.Featured Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Former SNL Cast Member Breaks Silence On Trump’s EMBARRASSING Behavior At Rehearsal (VIDEO),"A former Saturday Night Live cast member has just spilled the beans about one of Donald Trump s secrets.Taran Killam, who left SNL in 2016, completely destroyed Trump in an interview published in Brooklyn magazine, putting to rest the massive amount of speculation about whether or not Trump actually knows how to read. Apparently, Trump cannot. According to Killam, Trump  struggled  to read even the simple jokes the writers had given him.Trump made an appearance on the show in December 2015, right after he announced he was entering the presidential race. Killam said that particular episode was  not fun  and  most of the cast and writers were not excited to have him there. However, having Trump there taught the cast something interesting about him. During the  table read  prior to the rehearsal, the host of the week is supposed to read through the jokes they re given. Killam said Trump struggled to read at the table read, which did not give many of us great confidence. Didn t get the jokes, really. He s just a man who seems to be powered by bluster. I didn t get the feeling that he was excited to be there. When Killam was asked if Trump was  unpleasant  to work with on the show, Killam said: He was  everything you see. What you see is what you get with him, really. I mean, there was no big reveal. There have been rumors circulating about Trump s inability to read before, and now this confirms it. From Trump s refusal to read through documents in front of people to his tendency to ditch his teleprompter during his speeches, Trump s erratic behavior raised suspicions that he was hiding something. And when you look at a video like the one below, it certainly confirms Killam s confession that Trump is challenged when it comes to literacy.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Russia Probe’s New Leader Disqualified Himself MONTHS Ago With One IDIOTIC Statement,"With Devin Nunes  recusal from the House Intelligence Committee s Russia investigation, the committee needs a new leader, and that new leader is Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas. If that name sounds familiar, it s likely because Conaway made some waves earlier this year by saying something so stupid it should have automatically disqualified him from running this investigation.Conaway is the man who made the ridiculous comparison between Russia s meddling in our election, and Mexican celebrities performing for Hillary Clinton. Oh yes, to Conaway, they are one and the same: Harry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into Las Vegas, to entertain, get out the vote and so forth. Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. When he was pressed on whether Mexican performers are really on par with Russian hackers, he said: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Two things, idiot: First, foreign performers aren t working in secret. Second, foreign performers aren t working to obtain and release thousands of internal party documents specifically damaging to one campaign.Foreign performers are more like surrogates belonging to a certain demographic. Foreign hackers are more like spies working to sabotage something.And the man now leading the Russia probe tried to downplay it into nothing by claiming they re the same thing. It was the dumbest thing he could ever have said as next in line for the chairmanship because it proves he s both too partisan to run an investigation that should be as non-partisan as possible, and also that he s just plain too stupid to know what he s doing.Things just got very interesting here, and not in a good way. Can House Republicans offer up anybody capable of running this investigation the way it needs to be run? It s just gotten ridiculous now.Featured image by Lance Cheung, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr",News,"April 6, 2017"
 JUST IN: Man-Child Boasts He’s The Best President EVER; Doesn’t Know How Long He’s Been In Office,"You may not have noticed, but Donald Trump is an egomaniacal narcissist who has no concept of reality.

He has no clue what he s doing and belongs nowhere near the Oval Office.All that being said, he personally thinks he s wonderful and likely believes his sh*t smells like a spring meadow.However, he s also a bit of a dumbass, and all of these Trump qualities perfectly came out in a statement he just made aboard Air Force One overheard by NBC News  reporter Peter Alexander.According to Alexander, Trump said: I think we ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency.

" REPORT: Bannon Routinely Using Anti-Semitic Slur Towards Jared Kushner, WH Turning Toxic Quickly","Trump s inability to hire experienced, serious individuals to staff his White House has started to rot from the inside out. The group of men surrounding Trump on a day-to-day basis are fringe racists, incompetent liars, yes-men, goons, and at least one member of a Nazi alliance organization overseas. It s less  team of rivals and more dysfunctional group culled from the comment section at Breitbart.Worse still, Trump s two closest advisors   son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Breitbart owner Steve Bannon   reportedly despise each other, fighting  non-stop,  according to sources within the White House.Unfortunately for the dignity of the office, Trump s decision to hire white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his go-to guy is coming back to haunt him. Bannon has taken to using two disgusting phrases to refer to Kushner:  cuck  and  globalist. The word  cuck  is frequently flung around in fringe right-wing white nationalist circles and originates from  cuckhold  meant to denote emasculation. In more modern times, the term is often used by racists to describe a white woman cheating on her white husband with a black man. Bannon apparently can t stop using it in reference to Kushner. [Steve] recently vented to us about Jared being a  globalist  and a  cuck He actually said  cuck,  as in  cuckservative,  the administration official told The Daily Beast. Cuckservative,  a portmanteau of  cuckold  and  conservative,  has become a favorite slur on the right, used like a sexually and racially charged version of  RINO,  a Republican In Name Only.His other favorite is  globalist,  a term often used by white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups to mean  Jewish.  The term is considered a two-for-one slur within the right-wing community. Its origins in anti-Semitism is accented by its nativism. Here s how Daily Beast s Asawin Suebsaeng put it: Globalist  is a term typically used by nationalist, pro-Trump right-wingers against political opponents; however, the term has also come under fire for at times carrying anti-Semitic tones. (Kushner is Jewish.)The use of  globalism  as a stand-in for  Jewish  is well documented and seems to be particularly entrenched in minds of some Trump voters. Forward magazine did an excellent piece on why that is.For Bannon, Kushner represents  interests  outside of white America. Anyone outside Trump s White House probably isn t surprised what that means. Bannon is a long-time anti-Semite. According to testimony by his wife, he once vetoed sending his children to a particular school because he thought there were too many Jewish children there. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with Kushner is apparently too much for Bannon to handle and he s acting out.By the way, Bannon calling Kushner a  globalist  is reminiscent of when folks call Obama a  Muslim.  Just say the word you mean, man.  Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) April 6, 2017It seems that screaming  cuck  and  globalist  isn t winning him any arguments, even within Trump s administration. He recently got yanked for his position on the National Security Council   a spot he had no business occupying in the first place. In a clear humiliation, Bannon reportedly said he would resign if Trump dared pull him from the council. Trump called his bluff and Bannon blinked. But he s likely not forgotten the slight. Trump s White House is more toxic than ever.Sources have been leaking details non-stop and the picture is ugly. Pence hates Priebus. Trump hates Priebus. Trump hates Spicer. Spicer hates himself. Kushner hates Bannon. Bannon hates Kushner. Trump s new National Security Advisor hates Trump and everyone else in the White House.

 Nunes’ Replacement In Trump Investigation Defended Russian Hackers And Putin,"The new leader of what can laughably be called an  investigation  into the Trump Team s collusion with Russia to undermine our democracy makes disgraced House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes look almost sane.When he recused himself (temporarily) from the investigation after he became the subject of his own congressional ethics investigation for releasing classified information in an effort to help Donald Trump, Nunes handed off his duties to Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, whose own views on the Russia situation are, well, let s just say they would make Putin happy.When FBI Director James Comey testified last month, Conaway unleashed a weird defense of Putin, comparing his support of Donald Trump   which has been verified by 17 intelligence agencies   to football of all things. That might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife s (Texas Tech) Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns,  Conaway said.  She really like the Red Raiders. But all the rest of the time   the logic is that because he really didn t like candidate Clinton, it automatically [meant he] liked Trump,  Conway told a befuddled-looking Comney That assessment s based on what?

Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. Asked whether that is the same as Russia interfering in our election, Conaway didn t back down: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Assisting Conaway will be Trey Gowdy, who recently found himself the subject of an ethics complaint for accepting donations from anti-Clinton groups while he was investigating her and Tom Rooney, who very vocally opposed Clinton.Something tells me these guys won t be taking this seriously.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Elijah Cummings Called Trump Out To His Face And Here’s The Pathetic Way Trump Tried To Spin It,"Buried in Trump s bonkers interview with New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush is this outrageous exchange Trump claims happened recently:TRUMP: [U.S. Representative] Elijah Cummings was in my office and he said,  You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country. HABERMAN: Really?TRUMP: And then he went out and I watched him on television yesterday and I said,  Was that the same man? Which  would have been odd considering Cummings, a fiery Democratic congressman, has been one of Trump s most intense critics. He s very public about it. Cummings has been outspoken about Trump s disturbing connections to Russia, the GOP s botched attempts to cover those connections up, and has repeatedly demanded Trump divest himself of his numerous conflicts of interest. He hardly sounds like a person who has looked at Trump s trainwreck first three months in office and concluded that he deserves to be up on Mount Rushmore.One theory was that Trump flatly lied. Always a possibility   Trump is a pathological liar. Another, suggested by writer Jamelle Bouie, is that Trump mixed up two black men, conflating Cummings with some other guy. Another strong possibility   Trump has shown a complete lack of interest in the lives of black Americans.Fortunately, Cummings came in to provide the real answer: Trump took a criticism Cummings has made to his face and filtered it through his unchecked narcissism. Here s how Cummings describes the meeting Trump said was about praising him: During my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then, I have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if   if   he takes steps to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on. Note the jab that Trump completely missed? IF Trump stops being  divisive and harmful  he could someday be a great president. So far he has not done so. Hasn t even tried. (As if to underscore how little Trump has tried to stop being divisive, in the same interview he defended Bill O Reilly for sexually harassing women at Fox News.)Unintentionally, Trump s bizarre retelling of what went down during his meeting with Cummings exemplifies the warped way Trump sees the world. A criticism turns into praise, stripping away all context in the process. It may explain, for example, why Trump seems to genuinely believe he saw Muslim Americans celebrating on 9/11. His ego filters everything, facts get distorted and retooled for his own agenda.The fact that we have a president who does not seem to understand the difference between reality and the fantasy world that exists in his head is a recipe for disaster. If meetings with a congressman get this distorted, what other delusions is Trump living in?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Devin Nunes Hands Investigation To Others As Ethics Committee Investigates Him,"Donald Trump just lost another minion.GOP Rep. Devin Nunes has been in Trump s pocket since the election in November. He was part of Trump s transition team, and as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, he has been desperately trying to help Trump get out from under his Russia scandal.To that end, Nunes went to the White House in secret to inform Trump on the investigation. While there, he was fed a new line of attack to use in a pathetic effort to somehow prove that Trump was right about President Obama wiretapping him.Nunes failed to tell his colleagues on the intelligence committee and hastily set up a press conference. Nunes was later forced to admit that his  proof  was not proof at all.Complaints have been flowing to the Office of Congressional Ethics ever since, and Nunes has been repeatedly called upon to recuse himself from the ever-deepening Russia scandal investigation. Now the House Ethics Committee is starting an investigation of Nunes. So Nunes is stepping aside and handing the investigation over to other Republicans on the intelligence committee.Of course, Nunes channeled Trump by blaming the charges on everyone but himself. Several left-wing activists have filed complaints against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics,  Nunes said in a statement.  The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. As noted above, the House Ethics Committee is now involved and that s bad news for Nunes and Trump.The committee is comprised of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, which means Republicans can t just intervene to save Nunes. The committee can subpoena him and force him to testify under oath.Lying to the committee would constitute perjury and demonstrate that Nunes is working for Trump instead of doing his job.Nunes will have to explain why he wen t to the White House in secret late at night to discuss the investigation, and why he released classified information to the public without discussing the information with his colleagues first.As it turns out, the information Nunes received from Trump is the fact that some Trump officials were caught on surveillance of foreign agents. Nunes and Trump want us all to believe that the information vindicates Trump s accusation against President Obama.Except that the surveillance did not target Trump and his team at all   it targeted the foreign agents they just happened to be meeting with. And Trump clearly accused President Obama of wiretapping him specifically.Clearly, Nunes and Trump are working together to help him wriggle his way out of answering for the Russia scandal that has only become more explosive and damning. Now we just have to wait and see if Trey Gowdy investigates Trump s Russia scandal with the same doggedness he displayed during his investigation of Benghazi. Because if not, it s proof that Republicans are incapable of policing themselves.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
" Steve Bannon THREATENS Trump Over Removal From National Security Council, Administration In CHAOS","Yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming   that former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, who is now serving as Trump s White House strategist, was being kicked off the National Security Council. While Bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough, it turns out that s not how he really feels at all   and Trump is in trouble.According to a new report by the New York Times, Bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him. In fact, he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration. The Times wrote: Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence. Considering the fact that Bannon did not show up at Trump s press conference with Jordan s King Abdullah II, some bitterness on Bannon s part makes absolute sense.Bannon s position on the National Security Council has been controversial to begin with   it was a role he basically tricked Trump into giving him. Trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said   and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given Bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have. Bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the National Security Council, but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for Trump, the White House is crumbling due to its own erratic, inexperienced staff.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Even Trump’s Homeland Security Chief Thinks He’s Full Of Sh*t About The Border Wall,"While campaigning, Donald Trump vowed to build a  great wall  and Mexico will pay for it.  I will build a great wall   and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me   and I ll build them very inexpensively,  the former reality show star said at the time.  I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.  Well, that s not going to happen. Mexico is not paying for the wall and Trump s own homeland security secretary disagrees with the amateur president.Kelly said Wednesday that it is doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite Trump s claims. It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,  Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee, according to The New York Times.Instead, Kelly, who was appointed by Trump said the department will look to build physical barriers. That includes fencing and concrete walls in places that make sense.Like his presidency and administration, Trump s plan for the  great wall  is amateurish and chaotic.In February, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a border-state Republican, said that building a physical wall along the border in some places  makes no sense. There are other Republicans who were left scratching their heads, too, over Trump s nonsensical border wall.  I don t think we re just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in January.Still yet, Kelly defended Trump s  extreme vetting  proposal in which he insists that children would not be routinely separated from their families unless the  situation at the time requires it,  such as when the mother is sick or addicted to drugs. Right, because if a mother is sick, her children should be taken from her, amirite?It s not just elected officials who are wondering what the hell Trump is thinking. A supporter of the alleged president s found her home suddenly on the Mexico side of the border. We call that karma. Adding to that, Trump wants a 30-foot wall that looks good on the northern side of the border. We re not sure what she was thinking when she cast her vote for Trump. He was very clear in what he said, and as far as his lies go, she was warned by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Trump s Republican rivals that he s full of sh*t.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Here’s The Veiled Threat Trump Sent CNN Chief After Release Of ‘Grab Them By The Pu**y’ Tape,"There s a reason Trump hates CNN, and it s been obvious for a long time. However, what many may not know is exactly why CNN s negative coverage gets under his skin so badly. It turns out that he believes CNN owes him for putting their current president, Jeff Zucker, in place. When the network released the  Access Hollywood  tapes in which Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women, and then followed that up with increasingly bad coverage, he saw it as an act of betrayal.So he sent Zucker this letter: Jeff   Too bad you (CNN) couldn t be honest with how well I did in the debate. The dumbest thing I ever did was get you the job at CNN   you are the most disloyal person. Just remember, I always seem to find a way to get even. Best wishes, Donald J. Trump. Yep.  You are the most disloyal person.  Trump literally believes that Zucker should reward him with favorable coverage throughout what the rest of his career, or his whole career in politics, or something. Maybe he expected CNN to just ignore all the heinous things he does because he was so awesome to them way back.The hilarious thing is what s happened since. From The New York Times:[T]he only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump s war against it has amounted to a form of product placement    earned media,  you could say   giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment.In 2016, CNN made nearly $1 billion, which was the network s most profitable year ever. They re on track to beat that for 2017 already, and it s only April. Zucker s on a hiring spree. They re getting some huge scoops. The list of good fortune goes on.So revenge? It s backfired on Trump horrifically.CNN disagrees that Trump s 2012 lobbying had any effect on their decision to give Zucker the top position, and it wouldn t be surprising to find that they re actually telling the truth. Trump is a narcissist who believes he has far more influence over everyone than he does.Featured image by Shawn Thew-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Seth Meyers SLAMS Trump’s Defense Of ‘State TV’ Fox News And Sexual Deviant Bill O’Reilly (VIDEO),"On Wednesday night s episode of Late Night, host Seth Meyers ripped Trump a new one for his continued support of Fox News and his defense of Bill O Reilly. It s not only despicable that Trump (a known sexual harasser) would defend fellow sexual harasser Bill O Reilly, but he did this less than a week after he proclaimed that April would now be known as  National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Meyers, not one to ever let Trump get away with anything, dedicated his popular segment A Closer Look to this very subject and it was glorious. At the beginning of the segment, Seth focused on Trump s undying, and equally disturbing love and admiration for Fox News and his favorite programs on the failing network. You probably have at least a passing familiarity with Fox News if you ve ever visited an elderly relative or gotten drunk at a bar in a small-town Applebee s,  he said, introducing the segment,  particularly with one viewer, the president of the United States. He then went on to show pictures of Trump s free Twitter advertisements for Fox and said: The President literally just recommends TV shows now. Instead of a Bible, Trump should have been sworn in on a TV guide. That, of course, drew raucous laughter from the crowd, but it s so true! He cannot stop plugging this network and along with himself, he s made Fox News more of a laughing stock than it was before he was elected! Now, he s coming to O Reilly s defense, which is sure to make things worse for the network who has already lost over 20 advertisers amid the newest sexual harassment scandal they just can t seem to get away from, as much as they ve tried to sweep it under the rug. Soon the only advertisers left on his show are going to be Ivanka Trump s clothing line and Steve Bannon s skin worsener,  Meyers joked.Watch the full segment below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 6, 2017"
 This Amazingly Diverse Book About Santa Claus Will Make Right-Wing Heads Explode,"We all remember the uproar over at Fox News a few years back when the idea of a black Santa Claus came up. In fact, Megyn Kelly was so upset that she had to insist live on the air to all the little children of the world that Santa Claus could only be white. Well, if they were upset by that, they are going to really blow their stacks over the version of Santa Claus being rolled out in a new children s book.Called Santa s Husband, the Harper s Design book portrays Santa as a black man who is also gay. His husband is a white man. The husband also doubles for Santa at malls worldwide, and the book chronicles their happy existence in the North Pole. Aside from the heaping helping of diversity, even better is the fact that the book s author is Daniel Kibblesmith, who writes for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.Kibblesmith says of the concept, and how it all began as a joke with his partner: My fianc e [author Jennifer Wright] and I joked privately, and then on Twitter, that since every house has its own traditions and lore surrounding Christmas, we would tell our child that the black Santa Claus was the  real  Santa. If they saw a white Santa at the mall, we d explain that this was his husband. Kibblesmith also joked about it on Twitter:Me & @JenAshleyWright have decided our future child will only know about Black Santa. If they see a white one we'll say ""That's his husband""  Daniel ""Kibblesmith"" (@kibblesmith) December 3, 2016He then realized that it was something that people were actually interested in, due to the wide interest it generated on Twitter and said he saw  there was genuine interest in this book becoming a reality.  And voila! Santa s Husband was born. As for the racists and homophobes who hate the idea? Kibblesmith simply says,  everything is okay.  He goes on to say: Some people   not me   even believe that Santa Claus is just your parents, which would mean that there are as many interpretations of Santa Claus as there are different kinds of families. But again, this is only a theory, because Santa Claus is real, and we have written a book about him. Lastly, but not least, here is the book s adorable cover:Via Huffington PostThank you so much for writing this book, Mr. Kibblesmith. This is something that has been needed for a very long time. You re right   families come in all kinds of packages, and diversity is a strength, not a weakness.For those interested, Santa s Husband us due out in October. You can follow Daniel Kibblesmith here on Twitter.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Trump’s Administration Was Just Caught Up In Prostitution Scandal; Here’s How It Went Down (DETAILS),"While it can be said that no one is immune from punishment, a terrific example of that fact is how a Secret Service agent who was on Mike Pence s detail just got himself arrested.Why was he arrested? For getting caught soliciting sex from a prostitute.According to CNN:  a Secret Service agent on Vice President Mike Pence s detail has been suspended from official duties after meeting a prostitute at a Maryland hotel. One law enforcement source says the agent was caught after police saw him exiting the hotel. Apparently, this is how it all went down: The police responded to a call from the hotel manager who became suspicious of activity in one of the rooms. The source said this was not a sting. Now, even though the agent was off duty and wasn t currently guarding the *vice president, it is still illegal to solicit sex.CNN reports: A Secret Service spokesperson, speaking on the record, acknowledges  an alleged incident  occurred and says it involved an off-duty Secret Service employee and said that the matter is under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the facts.According to the spokesperson, the employee was required to surrender his weapon and official gear and was placed on administrative leave. The employee s security clearance and access to all Secret Service facilities has also been suspended. Tsk tsk. You d think someone, especially in the Secret Service, would know better. Especially considering the history of prostitutes with agents in the Secret Service.Who can forget the Colombian prostitute scandal of 2012 when nine Secret Service agents had been discovered bringing hookers back to their rooms?Mike Pence s former Secret Service agent will be disciplined, but it still doesn t look good for the entire United States Secret Service, or the *vice president for that matter. And you can only guess the big guy in the Oval Office doesn t like it.

" WATCH: Arnold Schwarzenegger Just BURNED Trump Over ‘The Apprentice,’ And It Is GOLDEN","Back in February, Donald Trump decided he was going to use the White House prayer breakfast to slam Arnold Schwarzenegger and  The Apprentice,  because the show s ratings had tumbled and there can be only one reason for that   His Trumpificence was no longer on the show. Trump asked everyone to pray for Schwarzenegger and his ratings, which he no doubt thought would get under the Terminator s skin.He couldn t have been more wrong. Van Jones just asked Schwarzenegger about this jab on his show,  The Messy Truth.  What Schwarzenegger had to say is absolute gold: It gave me an opportunity to go and shoot back and say, you know, that the show didn t do well because, you know, one-third of the audience left, because they boycotted the show because you re the executive producer, Donald Trump! He went on to say that, if Trump had just been open and honest and told everyone from the get-go that he was the executive producer, they d have had really great ratings!He also took the opportunity to poke Trump over his unconscionably thin skin, saying: I have thick skin.

 BOMBSHELL Report Just Dropped Showing Gorsuch Is A Fraud,"Apparently, original ideas are a liability in the Donald Trump administration. Nearly as many Trumpsters have been accused of plagiarism as weeks he s held in office. Okay, that s a slight exaggeration, but Neil Gorsuch, the man who s about to be rammed into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, appears to have plagiarized some of his writing.We should have known when Trump s own wife Melania plagiarized part of her Republican National Convention speech from Michelle Obama.Once in office, Trump picked Monica Crowley to head the National Security Council. You got it, she plagiarized her Ph.D. dissertation and the book she published in 2012.Crowley was forced to drop out of contention, but Betsy DeVos is Trump s education secretary and in a move that would get a child kicked out of school, she plagiarized part of the questionnaire she filled out to get the job. Now, it appears, Trump s pick for the Supreme Court is also guilty of plagiarism.Politico obtained several documents that showed several passages of Gorsuch s 2006 book,  The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,  were nearly identical to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. There were also several other incidents.In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her. Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982 Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known pediatrics textbook,  Rudolph s Pediatrics,  and a 1983 article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.Politico reports on documents showing that SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch plagiarized the work of others. Behold: https://t.co/XQnCmd62Ia pic.twitter.com/ooc2TkG2bA  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) April 5, 2017There s more. Read the Politico article for all the instances.The White House is calling the accusations false: This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed, professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch s scholarly writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the false attack,  said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.  There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court. Experts disagree with the White House: Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I ve never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,  said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue.Not that it should make much of a difference.

 House Dems Take On Fight For Trump’s Tax Returns With Bold New Move That Will INFURIATE Him,"Trump promised to release his tax returns, and then, as we all remember, made excuse after excuse after excuse not to. With tax reform now on the table, and Trump s plan taking center stage in the White House following the massive failure to repeal the ACA, House Democrats may finally have a way to force him to release his returns: Refuse to even consider tax-reform legislation until after they ve seen his returns.Seriously. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New Jersey, introduced the resolution as a way to discover just how Trump himself will benefit from tax reform before any legislation even makes it out of the committee:BRILLIANT! New Dem bill would delay Trump s tax reform legislation until he releases his tax returns: pic.twitter.com/2USVD4KNBf  Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) April 5, 2017When Republicans ask why Trump s tax returns are so important, this is why. Trump is already personally benefiting from the White House. His ideas for tax reform (along with the rest of the GOP s ideas) could be crafted around how it will help him continue to line his pockets.One of the most obvious problems is that Trump s cabinet is full of billionaires, and his tax plan, along with every plan of the GOP s, will amount to hefty tax cuts for the rich and for businesses. They do not help average Americans, who are the people most in need of tax relief.Furthermore, during the campaign, Trump called himself smart for finding ways to avoid paying taxes. Any tax reform he pushes Congress to consider is extremely likely to be of personal benefit to him because that s how he rolls. If it wasn t how he rolled, he would have officially divested of his business interests, he would not allow the government to fund the business trips of his two sons, and he probably would have let us see his returns so the entire country could compare his tax plans to the taxes he currently pays (or doesn t pay).In short, without being able to see his tax returns, President Rich-Bitch can do what he wants with taxes without much more than the standard outcry about tax cuts for the wealthy. Now, the Democrats  plan would allow the House Ways and Means Committee to review his taxes in a closed-door session, so they still wouldn t be truly public. However, if the Congressional committee in charge of taxes knows what s in there, then there s a chance, however slim, that we ll get tax reform that s far fairer than what Trump likely wants.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 WATCH: Adam Schiff Double Dog Dares White House To Let Sally Yates Testify,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, just double dog dared the White House to let Sally Yates testify.Speaking to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday, Schiff said,  the person that is in the best position to talk about the events that led up to his [Mike Flynn s] firing is Sally Yates.  Schiff told Mitchell that he has asked for Yates, who was the acting attorney general until Donald Trump fired her for defying him, to testify on what she told the White House regarding the disgraced former national security adviser s interactions with Russia. She is more than willing to testify, we have asked her to testify, the White House says   at least   publicly   they want her to testify,  Schiff said.  There is a letter sitting on the desk of my chairman that I ve signed, requesting that hearing to be rescheduled, and we are waiting for a response. Yates was scheduled to testify last month but Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), chairman of the committee, suddenly canceled the hearing without warning. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer keeps claiming that Trump wants Yates to testify and Schiff called their bluff on Wednesday. Sean Spicer has said he would like Sally Yates to testify, so let s hold Sean Spicer to his word,  Schiff said.  Let s bring her in and allow her to tell the American people just what led to Michael Flynn s firing and what she may know about any conversation he had with the Russian ambassador on the subject of relief from Obama sanctions on Russia over its intervention to help Donald Trump. According to Schiff, the only thing keeping her from testifying is that Nunes hasn t rescheduled the hearing yet.

 Reporter Reveals The Real Reason Trump Fired Bannon From WH Post And It’s Petty As Hell (VIDEO),"News that one of Trump s closest advisor, Steve Bannon, had been ousted from his position within the National Security Council, only further reinforced the disturbing amount of chaos happening within the White House. People are fired abruptly. People resign abruptly. And the reasons why are always obscured through a mountain of lies.In Bannon s case, the official White House line was that he had only been placed in his role to keep an eye on disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn.sr WH official tells me Bannon was only on NSC to keep an eye on Flynn & ""de-operationalize NSC from Rice"" & that he never went to a meeting  Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) April 5, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, the cover story was so hamfisted that it began falling apart almost immediately. In their rush to spin the story, top placed  anonymous sources  all began using the oddly specific word  de-operationalize  to describe Bannon s role suggesting this was a talking point being crafted from the White House itself. The excuse that Bannon was there to watch Michael Flynn is even worse. Trump has repeatedly stood by Flynn, so claiming he wanted Bannon to watch him means he knew Flynn was a crook but put him in the job anyways. Not a good look.What s the real reason Bannon was slapped down? A source close to Trump told White House correspondent John Roberts that Trump had grown increasingly jealous of Bannon sharing his  limelight. We are also told, though, that the president wasn t particularly happy with the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight and that may have also played into all of this. The other, other shoe drops. @johnrobertsFox:  The president wasn t particularly happy at the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight  pic.twitter.com/P3PIXNwL0n  Tom Namako (@TomNamako) April 5, 2017Which is kind of like life imitating art because for months people have been noting that the best (and perhaps only) way to stop severely unqualified Bannon from having influence in the White House would be to appeal to Trump s massive ego.Memo to all magazine editors: Put Bannon on the cover with big headlines referring to him as ""The Real President."" https://t.co/tMHXB5ZpVN  Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) February 7, 2017And Politico reported in February that Trump was already furious that Bannon was getting some of the credit for his administration s actions. It s an issue that s been nagging at him for months.Hilariously, Saturday Night Live seized upon this unique opportunity to piss off Trump by referring to a grim reaper clothed Bannon as  President Bannon,  playing up the fact that Trump wasn t really in charge.Apparently, this childish play on Trump s narcissism actually worked. Trump would never go after Bannon because he s unqualified and overtly racist, or that he once described himself as Satan and Darth Vader. But Trump would certainly go after Bannon for getting too much attention. And he just did.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Trump Stands Up For Fellow Sexual Harasser Bill O’Reilly: He Didn’t Do ‘Anything Wrong’,"On March 31, Donald Trump declared April  National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  On April 5   less than one week later   he said fellow scumbag Bill O Reilly didn t do  anything wrong  when he seemingly sexually harassed a large number of his female staff over the years. But then, Donald Trump himself has been accused of numerous sexual assaults and harassment, so birds of a feather.The New York Times got an exclusive interview with Trump and walked away with two bombshell findings, both awful in their own unique way: First, Trump duped veteran journalists Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush into publishing a slanderous claim that Susan Rice, the former national security adviser under Obama, had committed a crime. That would be a huge story if not for the fact that when asked to produce a single shred of evidence, Trump refused to do so. I think it s going to be the biggest story,  Mr. Trump said in an interview in the Oval Office, declining repeated requests for evidence for his allegations or the names of other Obama administration officials.  It s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time. He declined to say if he had personally reviewed new intelligence to bolster his claim but pledged to explain himself  at the right time. And he s currently already nursing several other claims   3 million people illegally voted, Obama illegally wiretapped him   which he has also failed to provide any proof for. Despite these repeated offenses, Habermann and Thrush ran the story as if Trump weren t the biggest bullshitter in the world. That s inexcusable.But Trump wasn t done. After pretending to uncover a major political scandal, Trump moved onto his friend Bill O Reilly. O Reilly is currently embroiled in scandal that may cost him his job after having been exposed as settling at least five sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him from female coworkers. Trump, five days into Sexual Assault and Prevent Month, jumped to his friend s defense. I think he s a person I know well   he is a good person,  said Mr. Trump, who during the interview was surrounded at his desk by a half-dozen of his highest-ranking aides, including the economic adviser Gary Cohn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, along with Vice President Mike Pence. I think he shouldn t have settled; personally I think he shouldn t have settled,  said Mr. Trump.  Because you should have taken it all the way. I don t think Bill did anything wrong. Here s what Trump considers innocent behavior   locker room talk, if you will   by O Reilly:The women who made allegations against Mr. O Reilly either worked for him or appeared on his show. They have complained about a wide range of behavior, including verbal abuse, lewd comments, unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if Mr. O Reilly was masturbating, according to documents and interviews.The reporting suggests a pattern: As an influential figure in the newsroom, Mr. O Reilly would create a bond with some women by offering advice and promising to help them professionally. He then would pursue sexual relationships with them, causing some to fear that if they rebuffed him, their careers would stall.Trump, of course, has a large list of his own offenses against women. During the campaign, over a dozen women came forward to recount times he had assaulted or attempted to assault them. Trump himself seemed to back up their claims in a leaked audio recording where he bragged about grabbing and kissing women even without their consent. Other women have also come forward to describe times Trump was sexually demeaning or suggestive to them.To watch Trump and O Reilly, both with histories of abuse, cover for each other is truly nauseating.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
" Trump Just Got SHREDDED By A Republican Strategist, Presidency CRUMBLING (TWEETS)","There s nothing odd about Donald Trump getting blasted day in and day out by the media and those who didn t support him in the first place, but the rate at which Trump gets crucified by his own Republican Party is unprecedented.The latest GOPer to take Trump to the woodshed is Republican strategist Rick Wilson, who pretty much obliterated Trump s presidency today. In several tweets this morning, Wilson brutally blasted Trump by stating the obvious, which many conservatives are still afraid to admit: Trump is Is.Bad.At.Being.President. Pointing out that  Trump s poll numbers suck for a reason,  here s what Wilson had to say about America s undeserving president: Then, Wilson lashed out at the remaining Republicans that are still defending Trump and standing by him despite all of his failures and shortcomings. In a shocking rant attacking conservatives that refuse to see how dangerous and incompetent Trump really is, Wilson continued:  Wilson is 100% right. Trump is NOT presidential material, and he has made very little attempt to actually rise up to the challenge of his new role and responsibilities. His polling numbers alone are the most pathetic we ve ever seen, and many Americans are in complete agreement with what Wilson is saying here.The Republican Party has screwed itself by allowing Trump to succeed. America will remember the GOP as the party forever attached to the least successful, most shameful president the country has ever had. Trump s ties to Russia alone will brand the GOP as the least patriotic political party in existence. The damage Trump has done to the party is irreversible, and Wilson knows it. He s part of the group of Republicans that is increasingly frustrated by what he sees of Trump and the GOP, and clearly, wishes this nightmare would be over already.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Trump Finally Booted A Certain White Supremacist From The National Security Council,"Months into his presidency, Donald Trump seems to have finally realized that it was probably not the greatest idea to install a prominent white supremacist media guy on the National Security Council. According to Bloomberg White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs, The Donald made a few changes to the Council   most notably Bannon s removal:NEW: Trump National Security Council reorganization:-removed Bannon-downgraded Bossert-elevated Coats and Dunford-McMaster sets agenda.  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017According to the White House, Bannon s role on the council was  to look over Gen. Flynn s shoulder    a position that is no longer needed especially after Flynn offered to roll over on his former allies in the Trump administration in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Officials claim Bannon did not attend a single meeting, and that his role is no longer needed now that National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster is in charge.NEW: Bannon's role on NSC was to look over Gen. Flynn's shoulder, a White House official said.He never went to meeting. https://t.co/mWsWjw7Qbk  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017Lest the real story here get lost, it s important for us to realize that the White House just admitted to giving someone they could not trust top-level security clearance and access to our nation s secrets   and assigning the white nationalist who used to run Breitbart, which he calls a  platform for the alt-right  ( alt-right  means Nazis), to keep an eye on Flynn s loyalties and actions.The Trump administration says Bannon was also there to  de-operationalize  the NSC from the Susan Rice era. He retails his top-level security clearance.In addition to keeping eye on Flynn, Bannon's role on National Security Council was to ""de-operationalize"" NSC from Susan Rice era, I'm told https://t.co/pCnBb4B06o  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017NEW: Bannon's national security clearance was NOT stripped, I'm told.

 Heroin Addict Trump Voter Sad Now That Donald Is Taking Away His Treatments (VIDEO),"Pennsylvania resident Kurt Farmer was perfectly fine with building a wall to keep brown people out of the country, banning Muslims from entering the United States, and Donald Trump s other horrifying policies, but he (like the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups who backed Trump during the election) also made the mistake of believing that The Donald had his interests as a white man at heart.Unfortunately, as a recovering heroin addict, Farmer is now suffering quite a bit of buyer s remorse after learning that his treatments are going to go bye-bye under Trump. Farmer relies on Medicaid to pay for his recovery treatments, and Trump is currently in the process of trying to gut healthcare for all those dirty poors in the country who act like the Constitution guarantees the right to  life  or something. If I didn t have Medicaid, I wouldn t be able to pay for this,  Farmer told CNN.  I would like to say I wouldn t relapse but the chances are from past experience, if I m not going to treatment, in a matter of a few weeks I start getting high. Farmer recently learned   like the rest of us   that the White House intends to allow states to opt out of the Essential Health Benefits regulations under Obamacare   the very same ones that force private insurers and Medicaid to pay for substance abuse recovery.Farmer is the most recent in Trump voters who have lost the faith   but only after learning that they would be hurt by his policies just as much as immigrants, Muslims, and others Trump and his supporters view as Untermensch.This is the difference between conservatives and the rest of us: While we realized The Donald is bad for America as a whole, they waited until he was bad for them to care.Watch the CNN segment below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Trump FURIOUS As Latest Obamacare Numbers Prove It’s Not Going Anywhere (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s approval rating plummeted after his disastrous attempt to get support for his American Health Care Act (Trumpcare) crashed and burned. It was a disastrous health care bill to begin with, proving to be higher in cost while stripping millions of Americans of life-saving health care   and Trump paid for it with his lowest approval ratings yet. Trump is swimming in bad news, but the latest info about the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) is about to make it worse.Apparently, the GOP s effort to do away with Obamacare has created quite the opposite effect   Obamacare is now more popular than it s ever been. Since the bill was signed in 2010, Americans are now more in favor of it than ever before:A new Gallup survey also echoes this monumental change   in the last five months alone, Obamacare approval skyrocketed 13 percentage points, and part of that change has been thanks to the GOP s failure to provide a better solution. The Gallup survey discovered that 55% of America now approves of the Affordable Care Act:Gallup s Jim Norman states that this has big implications for the law   and directly affects what the Republican Party may or may not be able to do in the future. Norman said: If that majority holds, it would be a significant development. Politically, it creates a major obstacle to Trump and Congress  ongoing efforts to change or replace the law. In future elections, it could turn the GOP s opposition to the law from an asset into a liability. More importantly in the daily lives of Americans, it might mean that the most sweeping changes to the nation s healthcare system in decades will remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future. Another poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation discovered that although there was equal opposition and approval for Obamacare, 64% of Americans were pleased that Trumpcare failed because it was obviously far worse. The majority of Americans (61%) are now also holding Trump and the GOP responsible for the future of America s health care, and strongly believe Trump should find a way to improve Obamacare, not repeal it.This information is sure to set Trump on fire, considering how desperate he was to get rid of the bill as soon as he began his role as POTUS. Given the fact that his ideas and agendas are more unpopular than ever, his presidency might be filled with Obama s policies and laws for quite a while.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 WATCH: Louis C.K. NAILS Trump And His Gullible Supporters During Appearance On Colbert,"If Donald Trump was watching The Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night he was probably screaming at the television.Because when comedian Louis C.K. made an appearance on the show he did not hold back when he was asked about the liar in the White House. Sometimes people lie,  That guy lied, they found out he lied.  Then there s somebody who lies because they can t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth,  C.K. began.  Then you have a liar, somebody who it s almost like a problem, they lie a lot. Then you have a lying sack of sh*t,  he continued as the audience became more excited.  That s somebody who just they just lie, they like it, he likes it. He just goes,  Heh heh, that wasn t even true, wasn t even true.  Then I said  they were liars.  It s just insane. It s just gross. He s just a gross, crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t, that s how I feel. The audience wildly applauded but Colbert alerted C.K. that there was at least one guy in the crowd who voted for the liar. Louis, there s a guy who voted for him up there,  Colbert said.That s when C.K. noted that Trump voters were duped. Trump voters were hurt the most because Trump lied to them and they believed him. Look if you voted, that s the guy he lied to,  C.K. said.  He didn t lie to me. He lied to him, he didn t lie to me. Everybody else was like  yeah, no that s not true.  But that guy bought it. He s the victim of the lying. Here s the video via Twitter.Tune in tonight to hear #LouisCK explain what kind of liar our President is. #GROSS #CROOK #DIRTY #ROTTEN #LYINGSACKOF  #LSSC pic.twitter.com/mMXbz5ShXA  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 5, 2017And Louis C.K. is absolutely right. Trump is the king of lies, his biggest of which is that he will  make America great again.  His lies about not having any ties to Russia and his lie about President Obama wiretapping him have also been widely covered and debunked. However, Trump continues to repeat them at every turn.A lot of Trump supporters now realize that they made a huge mistake as Trump s policies directly harm them and their families. But again, it s hard to pity a group of people who made such a stupid decision when it was crystal clear that Trump was lying. All they had to do is accept the facts instead of buying Trump s bullshit  alternative facts.  If they had done that, Trump would not be in the White House ruining their lives now.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 5, 2017"
 The FBI’s Russia Investigation Just Took A Turn That Will TERRIFY Trump (DETAILS),"The FBI is doing something with its probe into Russia s interference in our election that should terrify Trump and anybody in his administration, or who worked on his campaign, that has ties to Russia. Put simply, they re creating a special unit dedicated to better coordination of investigation efforts, and to give James Comey better insight into the probe s details.One FBI agent said that  it s meant to surge resources. This looks both like an expansion and streamlining of things. This particular investigation is getting so big that they re starting to have trouble managing it. It s not the first time they ve created a special unit for a high-profile,  sprawling  investigation of this nature. They did it when looking into Wikileaks  release of classified documents, and (because of course) when they were looking into Hillary s emails.It does signify just how seriously the FBI is taking this.There is a growing possibility that Trump or at least high-level members of his campaign colluded with Russia during the election to bring down Hillary Clinton and elevate Trump to the White House. They look so bad that the Obama administration created a document numbering system to personally hand over to the Senate Intelligence Committee to make it harder for Trump and company to hide documents relating to Russia.Trump was dismissive of the intelligence community s findings on Russia s hacking, saying that nobody had any idea who could have done it: It could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. Since then, he s continued to dismiss findings and allegations, refusing to believe either that his buddy Putin would do this, or that the intelligence community could possibly get so close to nailing him for collusion.Either way, the new unit will make the FBI s investigation run more smoothly and efficiently, and it will give Director Comey better knowledge and understanding of what s going on   things that he may have to present to Congress at a later date.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Lawrence O’Donnell Is Trolling Bill O’Reilly Over His Sexual Harassment Scandals; It’s BRILLIANT (TWEET),"In the age of Donald Trump, it seems that Twitter is ground zero for public spats, public shaming, and all sorts of back and forth exchanges. That is why this is the platform Lawrence O Donnell, host MSNBC s The Last Word, is using to troll Bill O Reilly s reprehensible behavior when it comes to what appears to be years and years of sexually harassing women from his throne over at Fox News.It seems that O Reilly is choosing to actually sue one of his accusers for speaking out, and O Donnell is determined to gin up as much public support as possible for this woman in her most vulnerable hour. He tweeted:O Reilly threatens to sue Wendy Walsh for ""defamation of Mr O'Reilly's character."" Sue me too because I believe her. https://t.co/jQ3y3mUvbM  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) April 4, 2017That isn t all O Donnell did, either. He tweeted that challenge to O Reilly while he was live on the air Tuesday night, and asked all of his viewers to retweet it, thus showing Bill O Reilly that the game is up, that we know what he did to those women, and that we know that he is bullying, threatening, and intimidating the accuser who is speaking publicly, Wendy Walsh, so that she will shut up.This is what using a public platform for good looks like. Thank you, Lawrence O Donnell, for standing up to the disgusting, misogynistic goon that is Bill O Reilly, and continuing to expose the culture of sexual harassment that is so prevalent at Fox News.",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Members Of Intel Committee Say Russia Scandal Could Result In Jail Time,"Members of the House Intelligence Committee are saying that Donald Trump and his treasonous cronies could find themselves behind bars. Two Democrats on the committee said today that jail time could very likely be the outcome of the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 election and Trump s possible collusion with them.On Tuesday, Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN s Wolf Blitzer that he  wouldn t be surprised after all of this is said and done, that some people end up in jail.  Blitzer pressed him on whether he  meant not just one individual, but people, plural.  The congressman wouldn t point to anyone in particular but did say  his impression  was that more than one person could find themselves behind bars. You re confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?  Blitzer sked. If I was betting, I would say yes,  Castro replied.Congressman Denny Heck, another Democrat on the committee, went a step further than Castro during an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday evening while speaking with Chris Matthews. I want to respectfully disagree with my dear friend Joaquin Castro, next to whom I sit on the intelligence committee. He said he would not be surprised if people ended up going to jail. I will be surprised if people don t end up going to jail,  Heck said.Matthews asked about FBI Director James Comey s announcement that a special unit was being formed to handle the investigation of Trump s shady ties with Russia. Heck replied that he was sure  anybody associated with the Trump orbit that was involved in Russia s financial entanglements probably was calling their lawyer today.

 Bill O’Reilly SCREWS Fox News As SHOCKING Amount Of Advertisers Abandon Network (TWEET),"One of Fox News  biggest and most successful news personalities is bringing the network down in a major way.Recently, The O Reilly Factor host Bill O Reilly was exposed for a massive amount of sexual harassment lawsuits that the network settled for him over the span of his career. As Fox has already gained quite the reputation for its sexist culture and tendency to protect its people from sexual harassment allegations, this is damaging enough to the network s reputation   but it s looking like the network will also suffer a big financial hit.So far   and this is just the beginning   as many as 20 advertisers have pulled ads from O Reilly s show over word of the lawsuits. These advertisers include major brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Mitsubishi Motors, Lexus, Constant Contact, Bayer, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, UNTUCKit, Allstate, Esurance, T. Rowe Price, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Orkin, and Wayfair. And of course, Fox News is trying to sweep this under the rug and pretend that these ad dollars are going to be used elsewhere on Fox. What else would you expect from the most dishonest cable news network?This is really, REALLY bad news for the network. O Reilly was responsible for bringing in over $400 billion in advertisements from 2014-2016 alone. If advertisers are deciding to walk away from O Reilly over these new revelations, this could really hurt Fox News  bottom line.Fox News is already struggling to begin with, as the network has lost almost all credibility for defending and continuing to support Donald Trump. The network has been proven to be highly inaccurate, and Trump has helped to make Fox News a joke when it comes to trustworthy media. O Reilly s recent scandal could be the final straw for the network, as it becomes even less popular than before.Featured image via Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images",News,"April 4, 2017"
 The Trump Administration Just Wrote North Korea Off – Trump Looks WEAKER Than Ever,"North Korea has been launching  intermediate range  ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan for awhile now, and, of course, it would be a good idea for us to have an administration that will actually speak out against this potential threat. Yet the Trump administration, for all Trump s bluster about Obama s  weakness  on Syria, just issued a statement on their latest launch that should make everyone s jaws drop. Rex Tillerson literally just said: North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment. ? This is Rex Tillerson s statement on North Korea s missile launch pic.twitter.com/S2xAgZAGlX  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 4, 2017That s the best he can come up with? Does Tillerson have no idea what he s doing? Probably not. No, North Korea just fired a missile into the Sea of Japan, which one of our own allies considers a threat. Back in February, they launched a missile into the same area and Trump had a pow-wow over it with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago, prompting tons of questions about the security of the place. Now we have no comment at all.Why?It s possible it s because Trump s both hoping and expecting China to take care of the problem so he doesn t have to. In fact, he sent Chinese president Xi Jinping a message that  the clock has run out on North Korea,  and if they decide not to help,  it won t be good for anyone.  The funny thing is he s all bluster here. He s being a peacock about it and hoping that China will see his feathers and decide it s in their best interests to help us with Pyongyang in ways they ve never done before.And then we won t have to do very much. We can t take unilateral action against North Korea and hope that China will fall in line, because we can t really take such action. China knows that. So what s Tillerson doing here? Making Trump look as weak as rotted wood on North Korea now.But Trump will use a gas attack on innocents in Syria as an excuse to blast Obama for being too weak. Good job being a world leader, Trump.

 Fox News Gets Bad News As Advertisers Start Dumping Bill O’Reilly Over Sexual Harassment Pay-Offs,"Fox News is now probably regretting their decision to keep Bill O Reilly instead of Megyn Kelly.Earlier this week, it was revealed that Bill O Reilly and the conservative network have paid off several women to stave off sexual harassment lawsuits.In all, five women have been paid $13 million of what amounts to hush money to stop them from publicly hauling O Reilly s ass to court.For years, O Reilly s behavior toward his female colleagues at Fox has drawn criticism and outrage, especially since he remains employed by the network.O Reilly and Fox previously settled a lawsuit filed by former Fox host Juliet Huddy and a lawsuit filed by Andrea Tantaros is still ongoing. The worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel,  O Reilly pathetically claimed in his defense after the new revelations came to light.O Reilly is trying to portray himself as the victim, but if that were true he would have fought the charges in court to clear his name rather than pay the women off.Fox News recently renewed O Reilly s contract because his show makes the network a lot of money, but that is all changing now because advertisers are dumping O Reilly.According to CNN,Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Constant Contact, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, UNTUCKit and Sanofi are pulling ads from  The O Reilly Factor. In a statement, Hyundai said they would rather seek partnerships with companies that don t condone sexual harassment.We had upcoming advertising spots on the show but are reallocating them due to the recent and disturbing allegations. As a company we seek to partner with companies and programming that share our values of inclusion and diversity. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation as we plan future advertising decisions.Mercedes-Benz said the same thing.The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now.In addition, Lexus and Jenny Craig appear to be leaning toward also removing their ads from O Reilly s show since they have condemned sexual harassment and promised to monitor the story as it unfolds.O Reilly may be Fox s cash cow but if more companies pull advertising money from his show they will likely be forced to reexamine his worth to the company. After all, Fox News has spent millions of dollars paying off his victims and paying legal expenses. If the company starts losing millions of dollars from advertisers they ll have to conclude that O Reilly is too much of a financial liability to the company to keep around any longer.And that could finally put an end to the career of one of the most sexist and racist loudmouths in all of cable news history.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Trump’s Son Thinks Batsh*t Crazy Pizzagate Conspiracy Theorist Should Get A Pulitzer,"We can t say enough bad things about rape apologist Mike Cernovich but Donald Trump Jr. thinks he s awesome. Cernovich is a major troll on Twitter and he s also promoted the insane Pizzagate conspiracy theory in which he and other right-wing nutbags allege that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta run a child slave ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C. Oh, by the way, I ve been there and there is no basement in the pizzeria.And then there was the time a comedian made fun of Cernovich on Twitter, so the conspiracy theorist Snowflake retaliated by suggesting that he was a child molester. In a now-deleted tweet, Cernovich wrote,  Have you guys ever tried  raping  a girl without using force? Try it. It s basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.  He also says that black women should be slut-shamed so they won t get AIDS. He s that kind of a guy. He s part of the  Alt-Right  (cough, cough, neo-nazis).Cernovich also circulated the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s while offering no evidence to back that up. Quite simply: He s a dick with no balls.Clinton is fading now, she can't last longer than 90 minutes, Parkinson's drugs wearing off. #DebateNight  Mike Cernovich ?? (@Cernovich) October 20, 2016So naturally, Trump Jr. is praising Mike Cernovich after the conspiracy theorist penned a story titled,  Susan Rice Requested Unmasking of Incoming Trump Administration Officials.

 Trump’s Longtime Friend Larry King Just STUNG Him So Hard He’ll Be Fuming For Weeks,"Larry King has been in the radio and journalism business since 1957 and he s a longtime friend of Donald Trump, so what he just said about him is significant.Trump has taken a ton of criticism since taking office over two months ago, and rightfully so.After all, Trump s scandals continued to stack up and his ineptitude has no end in sight. He opens his mouth when he should keep it shut and he embarrasses himself and this nation with every word he utters and every move he makes. He would rather golf instead of doing his damn job and he appears hell bent on destroying our government. He insults our allies and praises dictators. To make a long story short, Trump has turned America into a laughingstock around the globe.And Larry King put an exclamation point on that fact on Monday during an appearance on Sirius XM s  Tell Me Everything  with host John Fugelsang.King told Fugelsang that Trump s presidency is the  most ridiculous  he s ever seen and went on to slam Trump for appointing people to head departments they want to destroy, specifically referring to Betsy DeVos and Scott Pruitt, who run the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. It s almost funny,  King began.  To run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he hires an anti-environment guy. To run the Secretary of Education, he hires someone who doesn t like education. Doesn t like public schools. That s weird, man. King then further expanded upon his thoughts on the environment by calling out Trump s climate change denial. Trump gets us out of climate change. Who doesn t notice climate change? It s obviously caused by carbon dioxide,  he continued.  To act like it doesn t exist, that s insane. Miami Beach is not going to exist after 2100. Come on. That s climate change. To act like it doesn t exist is insane. I ve got to admit that so far, this is one of the most ridiculous presidencies I ve ever seen,  King concluded.Here s the video via Twitter.

 Women TORCH Ivanka Trump For Celebrating Equal Pay Day After Her Dad Reverses Equal Pay Protection,"Just like her dad, Ivanka Trump s hypocrisy knows no bounds.Donald Trump s daughter pretends to be a great champion for women and women s issues, but the reality is that she is complicit in the harm her daddy is doing to women across the country with his policies.In 2014, President Obama signed an executive order known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order.The law required companies that receive federal contracts to enact pay transparency so women can better fight for equal pay and ended the practice of companies forcing female employees into secret arbitration if they file sexual harassment claims.Well, Trump signed yet another executive order on March 27th to reverse that order and he did it quietly.But women definitely noticed, especially on Tuesday as the nation recognizes Equal Pay Day.However, there s not a lot to celebrate this year since Trump s order gives companies the ability to once again hide pay discrepancies from their female employees and force female employees who are sexually harassed or assaulted on the job to remain silent about it.Frankly, it sounds like another women s march on Washington is necessary, but for now, women directed their outrage at Ivanka Trump, who had the gall to celebrate Equal Pay Day on Twitter all while knowing what her father has done.#EqualPayDay is a reminder that women deserve equal pay for equal work. We must work to close the gender pay gap! https://t.co/CcwsoBXWdF  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 4, 2017It s kinda hard to  close the gender pay gap  when Ivanka s own dad is working to widen it.And women were quick to remind Ivanka of that fact..@IvankaTrump you can start by talking to your daddy-boyfriend pic.twitter.com/jPyz4BKiOk  Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump You may need to share with your dad how you feel, he quite obviously doesn t support #EqualPayDay #EqualPayhttps://t.co/UixxN2JDts  ACTIndivisible (@ACTIndivisible) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump Tell that to your father.

 Inventor Of The Worldwide Web Just DESTROYED Trump’s ‘Disgusting’ Bill To Sell Internet History,"This week, Donald Trump signed a deeply concerning bill that allows internet service providers (ISPs) to sell the browsing histories of their customers to advertisers. It s a disgusting piece of legislation that has Americans around the country concerned for their privacy and has left them feeling vulnerable   and the inventor of the worldwide web himself had some pretty strong feelings toward it as well.Tim Berners-Lee is the computer scientist responsible for the worldwide web we use today. Having seen how much his invention has grown since its creation in 1989, he says he has been  disgusted  by the law Trump just signed in, and has slammed both Trump and the GOP for it in an interview with the Guardian.According to Berners-Lee (and many Americans), user privacy should not be a partisan issue and he was quite shocked that despite facing so much public outcry, the Republican Party rolled this legislation through anyway. Lee said: That bill was a disgusting bill, because when we use the web, we are so vulnerable. Privacy, a core American value, is not a partisan thing. Democrats fight for it and Republicans fight for it, too, maybe even more. So I am very shocked that the Republican party has managed to suggest that it should be trashed; if anyone follows up on this direction there will be a massive pushback   and there must be a massive pushback! Berners-Lee s statement came with a warning as well   he predicted that the Federal Communications Commission would face massive protests if the net neutrality regulations that former President Barack Obama put into place were compromised. He said: If they take away net neutrality, there will have to be a tremendous amount of public debate as well. You can bet there will be public demonstrations if they do try to take it away.

 Trump Voter PANICKING After Realizing Border Wall Will Put Her House In Mexico (VIDEO),"D Ann Loop of Brownsville, Texas lost much of her land ten years ago when the Bush administration decided to put up a border fence that stretched across what used to be much of her property.Loop and her husband found themselves effectively locked out of the United States, as even their home ended up on the Mexico side of the fence. Their only access is a locked gate.The couple fought to keep their land   and lost   in court, placing all of their property on the southern side of the fence   and their nightmare is about to become very real for potentially thousands of people.You see, recently Texans along the border learned that The Donald was forcing them out of their homes for much less than they are worth. If they choose to stay in their homes, some of them have discovered they will soon be living among the criminal hordes down south. I was very angry, I just kept saying, how can they do that? How is that possible in the United States that they can do this?  Loop says.  They put up a fence in front of our land and then keep us in here   lock us in. I didn t understand. I was very   I was floored and flabbergasted. You hear that, folks? Floored and flabbergasted. It left us no property on the U.S. side of the border wall, including my house,  she says.  Everything was behind   on the Mexican side of the U.S. border fence. You punch your code in or you come behind the border wall, there is a feeling of isolation,  her husband, Ray Loop, added.Thousands of land owners   Trump voters and otherwise   along the Texas border will soon find themselves suffering buyer s remorse for the snake oil they purchased from our huckster-in-chief.Trump voter Pat Bell was fine with The Donald until she learned that his stupid wall placed her in danger of living like the Loops. While she opposed the wall because fences and walls don t work (she was fine with the other hatred espoused by Trump and his supporters, of course), she is finding herself negatively impacted by Mr. 45 s policies. Absolutely I would go to the people who are in charge and, you hate to say I would get a lawyer, but if it comes to that issue, you would,  she says.Trump voters are perfectly fine with banning an entire religion from entering the country and building a wall to keep all those dirty brown rapists to the south from entering the country   even gutting social programs   but the second Trump s terrible policies begin to affect them, they will cry about how unfair their lives are.Watch a report on the Loops  predicament below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Dem. Senator Promises To Filibuster Gorsuch Because Of Trump’s ‘Looming’ Impeachment (VIDEO),"Sen. Richard Blumenthal laid all his cards on the table when it comes to Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The Democratic senator from Connecticut argued that with the  looming  constitutional crisis facing the country and the growing likelihood that Trump will be impeached, Gorsuch should be filibustered.Speaking from the Senate floor on Monday, Blumenthal said that after deliberating carefully and deeply,  he has decided to vote against Gorsuch. He said that although he still harbors resentment over the way Republicans treated former President Obama s SCOTUS nominee, Merrick Garland, that isn t why he will be voting no on Gorsuch. But my vote is not about Merrick Garland. It is about Neil Gorsuch and it is about the constitutional crisis that may well be looming as a potential threat to our democracy. Blumenthal noted the testimony of FBI Director James Comey, reminding his fellow Senators that Trump is being investigated for possibly colluding with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. This, he explained, makes the Supreme Court more important than ever. The independence of our judicial branch has never been more threatened or more important. The possibility of a Supreme Court needing to enforce a subpoena against the president of the United States is far from idle speculation. It has happened before in United States vs. Nixon. President Trump has launched a campaign of vicious and relentless attacks on the credibility of our judiciary. His disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundations of respect for judicial rulings, the credibility and trust that is so essential to our Supreme Court and all our courts. And it is a respect that is vital to holding the president himself accountable to the people and our Constitution.The senator added that Trump had promised a  litmus test,  for whatever nominee he chose and as an  acolyte of hard-right special interests,  Gorsuch definitely fits the bill. Because of this, and Gorsuch s evasion of questions regarding civil rights, Blumenthal said he can be expected to attack abortion rights and same-sex marriage, among other things. All reasons he needs to be kept as far away from the bench of the Supreme Court as possible.You can watch Blumenthal explain why he will be voting no on Gorsuch, here:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Senate Dems Now Have The Votes To F*ck Gorsuch’s SCOTUS Nomination (DETAILS),"Republicans  pledge to make sure Trump s Supreme Court nominee goes through just hit a little bit of a snag with the disappearance of their filibuster-proof majority.On Tuesday, CBS reported that Democrats managed to gather the necessary 41 votes to ruin Donald Trump and his cohorts  week:The crucial 41st vote came from Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware who announced his decision Monday as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to vote on Gorsuch s nomination.Coons said that he had decided to oppose President Donald Trump s nominee over concerns that include his vague answers in his hearing.Coons  opposition will prevent Republicans from reaching the 60 votes they need to move Gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final Senate vote.Unfortunately, this doesn t mean that we won t see Gorsuch sitting on the Supreme Court. Republicans are likely to change the Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the current 60 votes needed.So far, two Democrats have betrayed Americans by siding with Republicans   West Virginia s Joe Manchin and North Dakota s Heidi Heitkamp   in supporting Gorsuch s nomination.Things are looking grim for those of us who don t want someone who have proved himself to be the enemy of women and disabled children on the Supreme Court. Keep fighting. Keep making phone calls.We must not allow Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 3, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Praises And Shakes Hands With Brutal Dictator After Previously Insulting An Ally,"Donald Trump is not just Vladimir Putin s puppet anymore.When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House, Trump insulted her by refusing to shake her hand. Trump s behavior toward Merkel drew international outrage. Not only did Trump insult Merkel as a woman, he insulted our longtime ally. Germany is a fellow democratic nation that has supported the United States for decades.As we all know, Trump has lavished praise upon Vladimir Putin, complimented North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and even invited Rodrigo Duterte, who has committed human rights atrocities in the Philippines, to the White House to pal around. You gotta give him credit,  Trump once said in clear envy of Kim Jong Un.  How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden   he goes in, he takes over, and he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. But Trump went a step further on Monday when he not only met with Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, but also shook his hand twice while being serenaded as  Your Excellency  by el Sisi through a translator.Trump bragged about the United States military and how he is making it even bigger and more expensive, and suggested that Egypt is gong to benefit a lot from it.After singing each other s praises, Trump eagerly shook hands with the dictator without having to be asked and later shook hands again.Clearly, Trump values dictators more than our democratically elected allies.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump has been an admirer of el-Sisi for months and even met with him during the campaign months before Election Day.The Egyptian dictator does not respect human rights and often puts advocates for democracy in prison.This is the kind of leader Trump respects and wants to be friends with and that s a problem that should not be tolerated by the American people.Also, Trump is a complete hypocrite. While Germany pays for their own defense and military, Egypt currently gets $1.5 billion a year from the United States, and you don t see Trump handing el-Sisi a bill for it. Trump certainly isn t demanding that Egypt pay up like he did on Twitter two weeks ago when he falsely accused Germany of owing America money for their defense.Donald Trump s insulting behavior toward our democratic allies and his admiration of dictators is un-American.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Racist NYPD Cops Threaten To Tase Black Children For Walking Down The Street (VIDEO),"Now that Donald Trump is president and Jeff Sessions is Attorney General, racist cops everywhere have free reign to abuse vulnerable groups of people at every turn. The latest incidence of said abuse was caught on tape by Brooklyn College Associate Professor of Sociology Alex S. Vitale, in which New York City police officers were seen telling a group of black students that they would use a taser on them if they didn t move away from the sidewalk. This is a definite abuse of authority, as the NYPD s official rules state that tasers are not to be used on minors.When the children were slow to move away from the sidewalk at the intersection of Bedford and Campus Avenue, one of the officers said, What are you going to do about it?  This apparently implies that the cops don t care about the children s rights, and would do as they please. A short time later, one cop asks the kids,  do you want to ride the lightning?  This appears to be slang for the use of a taser.Professor Vitale acknowledges that the actions of the officers on the video  seem [s] like an abuse of authority. Well, it certainly was abusive. Those children were not doing anything wrong. These cops are just looking to hurt black children because they can. They should be fired and charged with criminal offenses. Luckily, the kids involved in this incident weren t harmed, but, so many times, kids have wound up hurt or dead because racist, power-abusing cops decided to hurt them.The NYPD says that the actions of the officers on the tape are going to be investigated internally. Of course, that means nothing, because they are investigating themselves. They ll surely find that they have done nothing wrong, even though there is every indication, when one views that tape, that they ve done EVERYTHING wrong.Welcome to  community policing  in the age of Trump.Watch the disturbing video below:",News,"April 3, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Senator Lashes Out At CNN Hosts After Being Called Out For Supreme Court Hypocrisy,"Republicans are desperately trying to convince everyone that what they did to Merrick Garland was totally normal.On Sunday, Mitch McConnell pathetically defended his party s refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for President Obama s Supreme Court nominee by repeating the claim that it s Senate  tradition  to not confirm nominees during an election year. He also made the childish claim that Republicans did it because Democrats would have done it, even though Democrats have never done such a thing.What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was unprecedented and a total disgrace of the Constitution.But Orrin Hatch picked up where McConnell left off by using the same pathetic defense during an interview on CNN Monday.After being asked about what Republicans will do if Democrats block Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Hatch whined and accused Democrats of  politicizing  the confirmation process  while pretending that his own party didn t politicize it throughout 2016 when they refused to even grant Garland a hearing. They re politicizing this whole process,  Hatch said.  This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate, they don t like that. And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland. But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential year. CNN host John Berman called out Hatch s hypocrisy. But they look at you and say that s a double standard,  Berman responded.  You call Judge Gorsuch one of the most qualified judges ever to be nominated. Almost everyone said the same thing about Merrick Garland, including you. Indeed, in 2010, Hatch referred to Garland as a  consensus nominee  and said there is  no question  that he would be easily confirmed to the high court if nominated. Garland even complained in support of Garland in 2016 by whining about President Obama s choice before Garland was chosen. The president told me several times he s going to name a moderate [to fill the court vacancy], but I don t believe him. [Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably won t do that because this appointment is about the election. So I m pretty sure he ll name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants. President Obama made Hatch choke on those words by picking Garland. So there seems to be a double standard where you re saying, it was alright last year when we for political reasons halted the nomination of Merrick Garland,  Berman continued.  But it s not okay this year when Democrats try to halt the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Hatch responded to Berman by lashing out with a desperate defense of how Republicans behaved in 2016 towards Garland. I ll just tell you straight up, that s total B.S.,  Hatch said.  I can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn t agree. It was every right of [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] and Senate Republicans to say we re not going to do this in a presidential year. And at that time, keep in mind, it looked as though Hillary was a sure winner and we would have gotten an even more liberal judge than that one. But that was a stand on principle. Not some new barbaric thing that some have tried to make it. Here s the video via YouTube:Let s make something clear. What Hatch and his fellow Republicans in the Senate did to Merrick Garland was totally unprecedented. They not only rejected Garland after previously praising him, they even refused to grant him a confirmation hearing. That has never happened. Republicans were so unbelievably partisan that Antonin Scalia s body was not even cold yet when they declared that they would refuse to confirm any nominee picked by President Obama. And that brings us yet again to the Republican claim that it s  tradition  for the Senate to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during an election year.That s complete bullshit. As it turns out, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to Republican claims, the tradition is that nominees can be and are confirmed despite whether it s an election year or not.That means Hatch is lying to cover his ass because he knows he and his fellow Republicans are complete hypocrites and now that their hypocrisy is coming back to bite them on the ass they want to play the victim.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 3, 2017"

 Trump Just Went After China In UNHINGED Rant; America’s Future In FREE FALL (DETAILS),"It wasn t too long ago that Donald Trump deeply offended China by taking a phone call from Taiwan, violating the One China policy. Since then, foreign relations under this new failing presidency have been nothing but chaotic and tense   and unfortunately Trump is just making things worse.Over the weekend, Trump showed everyone that he s learning absolutely nothing about diplomacy, as he sent another  f*ck you  to China. In an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday, Trump warned China that if they don t get North Korea under control, America would step in. Trump said he is  totally  confident that the U.S. could handle North Korea s nuclear weapons program without any help. His words were: If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you. China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don t it won t be good for anyone. Then, he claimed that he could motivate China to move against the North Koreans, yet failed to clarify: I m not going to tell you. You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East. This interview also had several other insane elements to it, in which Trump continued to defend his lies about former President Barack Obama wiretapping him and insisted that those false claims were  turning out to be true.  However, his comments about China are likely some of the most disturbing to come out of the interview.Trump s timing couldn t be more disastrous, as he is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club this week   which will likely be another opportunity for Trump to disrespect China and put America at risk.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Trump Just Got Ripped APART After Demanding Clinton Apologize For Fake Thing She Didn’t Do (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s desperation to talk about something   anything   that doesn t involve Russia has caused him to lose what was left of his mind, apparently.On Monday morning, The Donald s descent into madness continued as he lashed out at Hillary Clinton.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017Clinton has not, in fact, apologized for receiving the  answers  (he means questions) for a debate, but she has a good reason   it didn t happen.Trump s claim comes from a fake news story in the Baltimore Gazette, a fake news source.The first presidential debate was held and Hillary Clinton was proclaimed the winner by the media. Indeed Clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance, but did she do so fairly? Multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claim that the Clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debate.Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton s campaign headquarters, according to multiple sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.Even though the story is a lie, right-wing websites, Russian trolls, and everyone who hates Hillary Clinton jumped on the opportunity to accuse the former Secretary of State of cheating.He then pushed his insane allegation that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower..@FoxNews from multiple sources: ""There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump.

 Trump Laughably Claims His Fake Obama Wiretap Claims Are ‘Turning Out To Be True’,"Remember when the world laughed at Donald Trump when he claimed that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at his gigantic golden tower in New York? Apparently he forgot, because he is still claiming it is true despite multiple intelligence agencies disputing the ridiculous allegation.In an interview with Financial Times, Trump was asked if he regrets any of his tweets   like this one:Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Now my last tweet, you know the one that you are talking about perhaps, was the one about being in quotes wire tapped, meaning surveilled,  Trump said.  Guess what, it is turning out to be true. It is not turning out to be true in the least. Trump Tower was monitored for two years ending in 2013, but President Obama did not order it; the FBI did, and the probe led to gran jury indictments of 30 people involved in a Russian money laundering operation including one of the country s most notorious mob bosses.In addition, numerous Trump transition team members were caught up in  incidental collection  while intelligence agencies were looking into foreign criminals.Trump s desperate attempts to distract from the Russia investigation   especially since Michael Flynn offered to roll over in exchange for immunity   are at this point pathetic.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Obama Officials Were Forced To Take BIZARRE Measure To Ensure Trump Didn’t Hide Russia Documents,"Investigations into Russian tampering and collusion during the election were gaining steam even before Trump took office, and the Obama administration was worried enough about it that they took an extraordinary measure to ensure that documents specific to the probe made it into the right hands.One former Obama official said that they had to create a list of  document serial numbers to give to senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee,  according to NBC News. The numbers aren t classified, nor is the existence of such a series, however, to ensure that the Senate Intel Committee actually received the numbers, this official actually hand-delivered them.The numbers were intended to make it more difficult for the incoming administration to bury anything.We have an attorney general who committed perjury. We have a former national security adviser who lied about his contacts with Russia. We have a man in the White House who staffed his campaign with people with ties to Russia. The RNC paid an intel firm that works closely with Russia to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton. The chairman of the House Intel Committee made it clear that he feels more of an obligation to Trump than he does to conducting a fair, impartial and thorough investigation. The list goes on, and Trump, given some of his recent tweets, is running scared.Besides that, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate Intel Committee have their hands on an unprecedented number of documents from the intelligence community relating to the probe. Ordinarily, documents of this nature would not make it into a Congressional investigation like this, but they have. That s probably put the fear of all the gods there are and aren t into Trump s black and shriveled heart.Since he had proven that the word  ethics  meant zilch to him following the Nov. 8 election, it s really no wonder that the Obama administration would worry about documents ending up languishing with the CIA at Langley, or possibly destroyed altogether, without anybody ever discovering their existence.The numbers went to people on Capitol Hill who are authorized to view their corresponding documents.Photo of Obama by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

 Maxine Waters: Let’s Talk About Impeaching Trump (VIDEO),"Rep. Maxine Waters says there s something she wants to talk about: impeachment.During a Sunday afternoon interview, CNN anchor Fredericka Whitfield asked Waters if Democrats were simply playing a game of tit for tat, going after Trump to get even for his role in the racist birther conspiracy surrounding former President Obama and the unprecedented obstructionism of Republicans.Waters said that even if you completely ignore  all of that,  what Trump has done since he was elected in November has been  outrageous  and  he has not provided legitimate leadership.  She said that she has no doubt that Trump was involved in the latest White House scandal with Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He has done so many things to show he doesn t understand government,  Waters said.  He s not willing to learn. He doesn t learn from his mistakes. Instead of learning, he gets up the next morning and tweets something all over again. Then, the Democratic congresswoman said that what she wants to talk about is this: if we can prove Trump colluded with Russia, then we can kick his orange-hued derriere out of the White House. We want to know whether or not there was collusion,  Waters said.  We want to know about the hacking into the DNC and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know because I know that if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable. A lot of people don t want to talk about that, but I do,  she added.Watch Waters talk impeachment here, via CNN:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Here’s The Third Turncoat Democrat Who Needs To Be Primaried Over SCOTUS In 2018 (DETAILS),"Another day, another  Democrat  who is backing the nominee for the Supreme Court seat that the Senate Republicans stole from President Obama. We have previously reported on how traitorous  Democrats  like Joe Manchin (DINO-WV) and Heidi Heitcamp (DINO-ND) have turned tail and voted with Republicans on many issues   most notably falling in line with Republicans in order to confirm right-wing potential Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Now, we have a third to add to that list: Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue: After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers. The only redeeming statement Donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the Senate should still have a 60-vote threshold when it comes to confirming Gorsuch or any other nominee for the Supreme Court. That is paramount, because it means that there is a true bipartisan Senate consensus for the Court s nominations and confirmations, which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary.Of course, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cares not one whit about that; he and his fellow GOP cronies have insisted that Gorsuch will be on the Court  one way or another.  This means he is willing to breach the 60-vote rule to make sure Gorsuch makes it to the Supreme Court. What the Republicans did to President Obama s nominee Merrick Garland is a travesty and a disgrace, and the Democrats should do the same for Gorsuch. For those who won t   PRIMARY THEM. We have no time for DINOS in these troubled times. Oppose Trump at every turn, or the good folks at We Will Replace You will have you heads, as they should.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Trump Just Got BURNED In An Epic Poem Written By A 14-Year-Old Boy,"Donald Trump will explode when he reads this.Trump is a national embarrassment who never should have been allowed to run for the presidency to begin with. His antics during the campaign and after have divided the country and turned us into an laughingstock around the world.Throughout his campaign, Trump attacked Latinos, women, African-Americans, Muslims, and Jews. He constantly bullied and threatened people. And he even urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and the DNC.Since taking office, Trump has been disastrous for our country. His scandals are racking up as much as his frequent golf trips and it s clear that Trump is incapable of governing responsibly and ethically. Trump has also embarrassed himself repeatedly on Twitter and often opens his mouth when he should keep it shut.And that s why 14-year-old Owen Pallenberg wrote a poem all about Trump s campaign and his various antics at the time and in the present day. The Race  begins with the campaign, takes us to the depressing election, and concludes with the aftermath and what should be done to rid our country of Trump.Here s the full poem via Huffington Post.A man and a woman were running a race.The man dressed in red with a very orange face,And the woman dressed in blue with a pantsuit and a briefcase.The race was much longer than a dash, mile or marathon,And to many Americans it felt like it went on and on.This was a race of old and new ideas and one thought,And so the race started with the sound of a gunshot.The woman dressed in blue was off to a great start,She was gaining support and was eager to do her part.However the man in the red was racist and sexist I m sure you would agree,He even said he wanted to grab a woman by her As the competitors turned the corner you got a glimpse of the fans,And you could hear in the distance a chant about a man with small hands.He claimed his hands and feet were quite big,All while having a bright orange spray tan and a big yellow wig.About halfway through the race the man was falling behind,And the supporters of the woman were happy to have saved mankind.As the competitors were nearing the finish line,The people in blue were already celebrating and drinking their wine.The woman approached the finish with a big, wide grin,But then something happened that seemed to be the work of Vladimir Putin.The woman fell down and lost her lead,The win began to feel a lot less guaranteed.The man hurdled over her body and crossed the finish,And we all knew our Nation s reputation would certainly diminish.The man had somehow done it, he actually won,The supporters in blue sat in shock and ceased all of their fun.The man was apparently going to Make America Great Again with his campaign,And the woman was depressed and had to put away her celebratory champagne .The results of this race tore apart our land,As millions of Muslims were immediately banned.This man can do absolutely no good,Except run his mouth and claim he was just misunderstood.The man has stated  we need global warming  for all to hear,Which has made me quite certain that the end is near.He has called women ugly and fat,Which has left me wondering how he could have won the race and done all that.After insulting and making fun of men and women nationwide,I ve become mortified, horrified, and have lost my American pride.Everytime he talks or makes a speech,All I can say is impeach, impeach, impeach.Now we just have to wait until Donald Trump becomes the first president to attack a 14-year-old kid.That would be a new low.Featured Image: Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"April 2, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump’s EPA Stooge Gets His A** Handed To Him By Fox Host On Climate Change,"Donald Trump is fuming after Fox New Sunday host Chris Wallace crushed his Environmental Protection Agency minion on the topic of climate change.As we all know, Trump is a climate change denier who thinks the whole thing is a scam created by the Chinese.So, of course, Trump chose a fellow climate change denier as his EPA Secretary.Scott Pruitt is an Oklahoma Republican who denies science, and during an interview on Fox, he found himself having to defend his anti-science views. Apparently, he hoped the interview would be a softball affair. But Chris Wallace repeatedly challenged him.Wallace began by slamming Pruitt s flawed logic that getting rid of President Obama s clean power plan will somehow improve air quality. You think that rewriting and, in fact, doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality, which you say is a major goal?  Wallace asked.Pruitt responded by claiming that President Obama was a tyrant who ruled through executive orders instead of letting Congress make the law.It should be pointed out that Donald Trump has signed 23 executive orders and he hasn t even served 100 days yet. He is on pace to sign 118 executive orders in his first year alone. President Obama only signed 276 over the course of eight years and signed less executive orders than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan.Trump could very well end up signing more executive orders than any of them. So, Pruitt can t seriously claim that Trump is following the  rule of law.  If anyone is ruling by  executive fiat,  it s Trump.Wallace then pointed out that Trump s deregulation of environmental protections has ceded the moral high ground to China in the fight against pollution and climate change.Pruitt didn t really give a damn. He said America has nothing to apologize for. We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the leadership we ve show as a country,  he claimed.Oh, but we do. Fighting climate change to save out planet will take international cooperation on a unprecedented scale. By withdrawing American leadership, Trump is sentencing the globe to disastrous climate change as if he thinks the United States is not part of the world and is somehow immune to what happens around us.Wallace proceeded to take on Pruitt s belief that humans are not responsible for climate change. Mr. Pruitt, there are all kinds of studies that contradict you,  Wallace noted.  The UN panel on climate change says it s 95 percent likely that at least half of the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that s all a coincidence? In response, Pruitt contradicted his own claim that he and Trump are working to improve air quality by insisting that the EPA should not be able to regulate greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.Wallace called Pruitt out an dropped the hammer on him. Sir, you re sugar coating what you have said. You said that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is, what if you re wrong? What if, in fact, the Earth is warming, what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Don t you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air, you don t think that plays a role? Pruitt answered by claiming that America burns coal cleanly, which is not true at all. There is no such thing as  clean coal,  and making such a claim is asinine.Here s the video via YouTube.According to Popular Mechanics,Coal will never be clean. It is possible to make coal emissions cleaner. In fact, we ve come a long way since the  70s in finding ways to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions, and more progress can be made. But the nut of the clean-coal sales pitch is that we can also bottle up the CO2 produced when coal is burned, most likely by burying it deep in the earth. That may be possible in theory, but it s devilishly difficult in practice.President Obama s clean power plan would have reduced carbon emissions more than they ever have been before. It was a crucial step toward fighting climate change and reducing America s role in causing it.But Donald Trump and his minions have reversed that progress and they are making things even worse. They are gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and have pulled America out the fight against climate change. So instead of moving forward, Trump is taking America backwards and that decision will have devastating results that Trump will personally experience once his Mar-a-Lago resort is under water because of sea level rise.Maybe when his precious golf club and resort is under water he ll admit that climate change is real. But by then, it will be too late.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Confused Old Man Shows Up At The Golf Course Instead Of His Job For 14th Time In 10 Weeks,"A tired 70-year-old man keeps forgetting to show up at his new job and instead, he has repeatedly gone golfing. The irony is that this same man routinely mocked the man who previously held his job for golfing. This man s job title: Commander-in-Chief. We suspect that former reality show star Donald Trump didn t realize that being the alleged leader of the free world would be a difficult job. Trump is up to his eyeballs in scandals and instead of addressing them, he s either tweeting or on the golf course, or both.Again, the Twitter-addicted amateur president is playing golf at a Trump-owned golf course, raising more concerns over his mounting conflicts of interest.The White House press pool reports that Trump is meeting with budget director Mick Mulvaney and Senator Rand Paul. Last time Trump went golfing, he claimed to be in meetings, however, that doesn t appear to be true.Trump returned to the same golf club in Virginia.Last year, during a campaign rally, Trump referred to his golf courses when criticizing former President Barack Obama.The Independent reports:The President has visited his own-branded properties approximately once every three days during the course of his presidency so far, according to The Washington Post. You know what   and I love golf   but if I were in the White House, I don t think I d ever see Turnberry again,  Trump declared.  I don t think I d ever see Doral again, I own Doral in Miami, I don t think I d ever see many of the places that I have. I don t ever think that I d see anything, I just wanna stay in the White House and work my ass off, make great deals, right? Who s gonna leave? I mean, who s gonna leave?  he said.At a 2016 rally in Virginia, Trump said,  I m going to be working for you, I m not going to have time to go play golf.

 Trump Embarrasses Himself With Yet Another Desperate Tweet About Russia (TWEETS),"On Sunday morning. Donald Trump once again revealed how desperate he is with regard to that teensy tiny little Russia thing with yet another unhinged tweet complaining about people leaking information about his team s collusion with Vladimir Putin.Recently, Michael Flynn s offer to testify in exchange for immunity   a condition he said last year was an indicator that one is guilty of something   sent The Donald into what can only be described as a complete panic. Trump, who agrees that immunity means  guilty,  also says that Flynn should get himself some immunity.It s clear that something is rotten in Trumpvillle, and our so-called President knows exactly what it is   all those damn people revealing his administration s secrets involving Vladimir Putin, his allies, lots of money, some hackers and fake news creators, and probably a couple of Russia pee pee hookers.Once again, Trump complained about all the leaks that don t happen on a Moscow hotel bed Barack Obama once slept in.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2017The real story is actually the fact that 17 intelligence agencies agree that Vladimir Putin directly interfered in our election through both state-funded hacking and propaganda efforts involving multitudes of actual paid trolls.

 WATCH: Chuck Todd Puts The Screws To Mitch McConnell For Not Giving Merrick Garland A Chance,"Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Federal Judge Rules That Trump DID Incite Violence During 2016 Campaign (DETAILS),"Hearing about violence at Trump s rallies was a regular occurrence during his 2016 campaign and that violence was often brought on by Trump himself.At a rally back in March of 2016, Trump yelled,  Get  em out of here,  referencing the peaceful protesters in the crowd, which then prompted his supporters to physically attack them. The protesters who were attacked brought suit against Trump and it looks like he s finally going to have to pay for it   in more ways than one.Trump s lawyers have been using the free speech defense, but a Federal Judge isn t buying it. Citing case law from 1960 s student protests and race riots, Judge David Hale of Kentucky, rejected motions to dismiss the case and said that Trump did indeed cite violence at his rally. It is plausible that Trump s direction to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force. Unlike the statements at issue in the cases cited by the Trump Defendants,  get  em out of here  is stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command. Trump craves the sound of people cheering him on, and no doubt probably enjoyed seeing his supporters attack people who were brave enough to show up and stand against him, so it wasn t surprising when Trump denied wrongdoing of any sort and blamed it all on the  bad dudes  who were protesting. In fact, that phrase became a regular mantra for Trump. We have some protesters who are bad dudes,  he said. They have done bad things, and they are really dangerous and get in there and start hitting people, and we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people.   It s usually the police, the municipal government because I don t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. The suit against Trump also names the three individuals responsible for the attacks, one of whom, Matthew Heimbach, is a leader of the white supremacist group Traditional Youth Network from Paoli, Indiana, which will probably make it that much worse for Trump. Watching him try to squirm his way out of this one should be really fun!Featured image via Getty/Sarah Rice",News,"April 2, 2017"
 John McCain Was Asked If Trump Was Like Reagan; His Answer Was PERFECT (VIDEO),"For Republicans, being compared to Ronald Reagan is something akin to being compared to Jesus. Both figures are revered among Republicans for being nothing like they actually were. Of course, that doesn t stop many from comparing Donald Trump to Reagan, when pretty much the only things they had in common were being wealthy and having few skills other than being showmen. Okay, perhaps they do have quite a bit in common, but when John McCain was asked by David Axelrod if Trump was like Reagan, his answer was a firmly decisive  no. McCain said he found  appalling  Trump s assertion in an interview earlier this year that the US lacked the moral standing to question Russian President Vladimir Putin s human rights abuses.  We ve got a lot of killers. What do you think, our country s so innocent?  Trump said at the time. To state that there s some moral equivalency between an imperfect nation   that s the United States of America   and Vladimir Putin is appalling,  McCain responded. And I think it s pretty clear that there s a difference between, well, aren t we killers and the guy that stood there and said,  Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall,'  he said.McCain even went so far as to say that in Russia s interfering in our election, they ve done something far worse than attack us with conventional weapons. It s one thing to destroy a building with a bomb or inflict damage, but if you destroy the fundamentals of a free and open society, which is what democracy is all about, you inflict incredibly heavier damage,  he said.Here s the video:Reagan, of course, became president during the Cold War, when Russia was the Soviet Union. It was communist instead of a capitalist oligarchy. Getting into bed with Russians then wouldn t have won him the white Middle America poorly educated vote. Times, though, have changed. Russia is no longer filled with commies and well, we had eight years of a black guy and the very real prospect that the next president would have been a woman. To Trump voters, that s much scarier than anything a former KGB agent who s known to kill his political enemies can do.The fact that McCain is saying this is significant, though. The investigation may be stalled in the House but it s now in the Senate and there is no Devin Nunes. Even Republicans seem in shock by the actions of the Russians. McCain isn t the only one. As for Reagan, well, he had a little thing called Iran-Contra which helped him win his election. So, I guess he and Trump have even more than being rich hacks in common. They were both propelled into office by a hostile foreign country.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Pete Souza’s Instagram Is A GOLDMINE For Those Of Us Missing President Obama (IMAGES/VIDEOS),"Former White House photographer Pete Souza has spent the last eight years of his life photographing President Obama and his family inside the White House. Now that we re in the Trump era, one peek at Souza s Instagram account shows just how much he loathes Donald Trump. Usually, Souza trolls Trump with photos of his much more classy and capable predecessor.

 DNC Chair Not Holding Back On GOP: ‘They Don’t Give A Sh*t About People’ (VIDEO),"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez didn t mince words when he called out the GOP for their appalling health care plan. Their plan would have resulted in tens of millions of Americans being without insurance coverage by the end of the next decade. Perez made his point loud and clear when he explained that the reason Republicans are okay with this plan is because they just  don t give a sh*t about people. Perez made the comments at an event for the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, which was broadcast live on Facebook. While speaking to the crowd, he discussed Republicans  failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last month.The DNC chair said that Trump  wants his name on everything,  but for some reason, he didn t want his name associated with the GOP s  Make America Sick Again  plan in any way, shape, or form. Well I ll tell you my idea, because you know what embodies their program?  I don t care,  Perez said of the GOP s health care plan, prompting a round of applause from the crowd. Because they don t give a s  about people. Perez served as former President Barack Obama s Labor secretary and was elected as chairman of the DNC in February. His first act in this new role was to nominate Rep. Keith Ellison, who had run against him for the position, as his deputy.You can watch Perez slam the GOP and their wealth care plan in the video below, via the New Jersey Working Families Alliance: Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"

 REPORT: Trump Is Costing America BILLIONS In Tourism Revenues Because People Are Afraid To Travel Here,"Donald Trump won t tell you this on his Twitter feed.The last time the tourism industry in this country saw such a drop was in the decade after 9/11.And now, Trump is the reason why people don t want to come to America.Under President Obama, the tourism industry enjoyed a resurgence as the number of international visitors rose to 78 million in 2015, a 27 million increase from 2006.But that s imploding now as Trump s policies continue to scare the hell out of people around the globe.Trump s travel ban, his proposed border wall, his attacks on our allies, and his anti-immigrant nationalist policies have struck fear into international travelers who wish to come to the United States to tour the land of the free.According to Alternet,Frommer s, a prominent travel guide, notes that  the prestigious Travel Weekly magazine (as close to an  official  travel publication as they come) has set the decline in foreign tourism at 6.8 percent  for this year. ForwardKeys, which crunches travel numbers, points to a 6.5 percent downturn in international travel to the U.S. in the week after Trump attempted to issue the Muslim travel ban in January. During the same period, the company found reservations for U.S.-bound flights from Western Europe fell 14 percent and plunged 38 percent from across the Middle East. And a survey released this month by the Global Business Travel Association concluded  45 percent of European business travel professionals say they are less likely to schedule meetings or events in the U.S.,  according to the Los Angeles Times.Even white foreigners from Canada and Europe are choosing to stay away from the United States because of Donald Trump.And the impact will do a lot of damage to our economy, including a loss of jobs and a decrease in our gross domestic product.The loss of all those visitors could mean future problems for a sector on which more than 15 million people rely for employment. Oxford Economics suggests the toll may ultimately ripple beyond the travel industry, even reducing the U.S. gross domestic product by a few percentage points, per Market Watch.This will particularly affect cities and states on the coasts where popular destinations such as Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City are located. As stated above, the ripple effects could reach beyond the travel industry as the lack of tourism dollars will hurt the hotel industry, restaurants, airlines, retail stores, and any other industry that profits from tourism.So this is a big deal that will hurt our country as long as Trump remains in office.America s thriving $250 billion tourism industry is about to take a serious $7.4 billion hit because of Trump s policies. It s a huge setback on our economy and it s only going to get worse as Trump continues to attack Mexico and China.So just remember that while Trump continues to tout plans by automakers and other companies that were made way before he took office, the tourism bubble is about pop on his watch and his policies are directly to blame.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"
 Trump Makes An Absolute FOOL Of Himself On April Fool’s Day; Americans Outraged,"His accusation that President Obama wiretapped him has been thoroughly debunked but Donald Trump attacked NBC anchor Chuck Todd for not covering the fake story.Last month, Trump posted a series of tweets openly accusing President Obama of wiretapping him.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump s accusation set off a firestorm around the country because Trump literally accused a former president of a felony.As it turns out, Trump s accusation was totally wrong. FBI Director James Comey dropped a bombshell on Trump s claim by stating under oath that there was no such wiretap. Furthermore, when given a deadline to provide evidence to Congress supporting Trump s claim, the Justice Department didn t deliver because there is no such evidence.Trump s claim was merely meant to distract Congress and the media from focusing on the growing Russia scandal.NBC anchor Chuck Todd was not distracted by Trump, and that s why Trump attacked Todd on Saturday and repeated his accusation against President Obama in yet another embarrassing rant on Twitter.When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017It is the same Fake News Media that said there is  no path to victory for Trump  that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017Again, Trump is falsely accusing President Obama of wiretapping him even though the claim has been debunked by high level authorities. Also, Comey told Congress that the FBI is investigating Trump for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election.And the evidence against Trump continues to pile up. Even disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is asking for an immunity deal. His testimony could blow the lid off the Russia scandal and put Trump behind bars for high treason.Thus far, Todd has not responded to Trump s attack, but Twitter did it for him.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews I love how the president calls people names.

 George Takei Just Shook Washington To Its Core; The Reason Will Make Team Trump FURIOUS (DETAILS),"By now, we all know that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has turned tail and gone off on what his fellow GOPer in the Senate, Lindsey Graham (R-SC) calls an  Inspector Clouseau investigation.  In other words, Nunes is a bumbling idiot and a stooge for the Trump White House when it comes to investigating ties between officials from Donald Trump s presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.Well, it now seems that Nunes (R-CA) might have a bit of a problem come 2018. Star Trek star and wildly popular  LGBTQ rights activist George Takei is running for Congress   against Nunes. The endeavor was largely secret, until Takei and his husband were found out as they started scoping out property to buy in Nunes s red district. Takei says of the move: Well, I guess the jig is up.  With what is going on now in the country, I couldn t stand by any longer merely as a citizen. I knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that s why I m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Davin Nunes for his seat in 2018. I think Nunes is vulnerable. And I plan to prove that. People are tired of his ass-kissing of Trump. Can I say that? I think I can. These days you can say pretty much anything and not get in trouble. I want to be a champion for all people, but especially those whose voices are not heard often in the halls of Congress. We need to build a majority again in Congress, too, to be a check against the Trump Administration s excesses, assuming he s even around by then to keep making horrific mistakes.

 Elijah Cummings Just Asked 5 Questions The White House Is Scared To Death Of Answering,"Rep. Elijah E. Cummings is demanding answers after presidential staff members reportedly passed confidential information to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and helped him sneak onto White House grounds.Cummings, who is the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to White House Counsel Donald McGahn and National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on Friday in which he asked some questions the White House really doesn t want to answer.The letter made it clear that Cummings wants to know just exactly who knew what when. Over the past two days, press accounts have reported that staff who work directly for you contacted Rep. Devin Nunes, the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, secured his entry into the White House complex on March 21, 2017, and provided him with access to classified information, which he then conveyed to the President the following day.  I am writing to request information about whether you both were aware of these actions I do not know if these press accounts are accurate, but if they are, they raise serious questions in light of previous denials by the White House and the fact that these White House officials report to you,  Cummings wrote. The Democratic congressman cited multiple conflicting reports that have come from the administration. After naming the staffers and the allegations against each of them, Cummings asked five questions that have the White House scared to death:(1)  Were either of you personally aware of the activities of your own staff in contacting Chairman Nunes, facilitating his entry onto the White House grounds, or providing him with access to classified information?(2)  If so, when did you become aware?  Did you inform Mr. Spicer of their activities, and if so, when did you do so?(3)  If you were not aware, then how did this breach of the chain of command occur?(4)  If these activities occurred without your knowledge, will any disciplinary measures be taken against these staff for this apparent breach?(5)  Was anyone else at the White House involved in these activities, and if so, who?Cummings  questions should have the Trump administration shaking in their boots. No doubt we will hear far more lies from the White House before we ever get close to the truth. Cummings gave McGahn and McMaster until April 7 to respond with their next version of the truth.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"
 Trump Has Brain Fart In Middle Of Executive Order Signing Leaving Pence To Frantically Cover (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is unwell.The beleaguered president seemed vaguely irritated and distracted in what was meant to be a routine executive order signing. After remarks by Mike Pence, Trump said just a few words before hastily leaving the room. The one thing he forgot to do was the whole reason he was there in the first place: sign the executive order.Realizing Trump s mistake, Pence scrambles to stop Trump and get him to sign the document. Instead, Trump orders him to get the folder from his desk and bring it to him to sign outside of the room. Pence, realizing he s about to go viral as a bit player in Trump s latest on-camera screw up, awkwardly saunters over to the desk, grabs the folder and rushes out of the room.Trump walked out of an executive order signing ceremony without having signed the executive orders pic.twitter.com/v0SjanotTe  POLITICO (@politico) March 31, 2017Trump appeared reluctant to come back into the room and it s pretty obvious why.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017It s understandable that he didn t want to explain the tweet, it could lead to Trump s eventual downfall. As the New York Times points out, should the DOJ give Michael Flynn immunity, it would mean they likely have bigger fish to fry.Immunity should be granted as soon as Congress and prosecutors are persuaded that Mr. Flynn has information that will lead to a criminal case against one or more people at least as important to the alleged wrongdoing as Mr. Flynn may be. The overriding objective must be learning who if anyone in the United States collaborated with the Russians as well as who knew about it, what they knew and when they knew it.Who might that big fish be?

 Looks Like Mike Pence Is Gonna Go Down With The #TrumpRussia Ship (VIDEO),"If there is anyone who is a thorn in the side of the Donald Trump administration, it s MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. She is relentless in her thorough and well thought out journalism, exposing Trump for the fraud that he is.In yet another report, while many think if Trump is impeached or forced to resign Mike Pence will take over the role of president, Maddow is letting America and the world know he may go down with the ship.Maddow reports: Mike Pence had been the head of the Trump transition. As such, he would have been intimately involved with the selection and vetting process for a job as important as national security adviser. Nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence has professed absolute ignorance of any of the scandals of any of the foreign payments, contacts and all the rest of it surrounding Mike Flynn. Pence was the leader of the transition. As leader of the transition, he was notified in writing by members of Congress about Flynn s apparent financial ties to the government of Turkey. The transition was also apparently notified twice by Flynn s own lawyers about his financial relationship with the government of Turkey, but nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence says he has no idea about any of that. Further: Vice President Mike Pence claims he had absolutely no idea about that despite him being notified about on the record multiple times and it being a matter of considerable public discussion. Mike Pence s role in the Mike Flynn scandal is flashing like a red beacon for anyone who sees him as the normal Republican in this setting. Maddow is absolutely correct. There is no way, with all this information coming out, that Pence was left completely in the dark with no knowledge of what has been going on. If Trump is going down, Pence will undoubtedly go down with him   as he should.Watch Maddow here:Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images   HT Politicus",News,"March 31, 2017"
 Study Shows Conservative Voters Are Literally Twice As Shallow As Liberal Voters (DETAILS),"A study was just released that said that conservative politicians are better looking than their liberal counterparts, and the reason for it shows that liberals are better at picking leaders.The study, published in the Journal of Public Economics, and performed by researchers at the University of Helsinki, examined politicians and academics from Europe and the United States. The fact that left-leaning scholars are perceived as better-looking is no cause for alarm,  Prof (Jan-Erik) L nnqvist said.  What is worrying, however, is the high degree of importance attached to looks in political elections. He added:  The results of my study are in concordance with other studies that show that the effect of attractive looks is twice as large for politicians on the right compared to their counterparts on the left. While it did not find that conservative academics were better looking, conservative politicians won the overall beauty contest and believe it or not, that s likely how we got Donald Trump.Hear me out. No, while Trump is expert at leering at and sexually harassing beauty contestants, there s no sash in his future. So, what does Trump s election have to do with conservatives being more attractive people? Conservative voters, it seems, are shallow people. They are less capable of getting past the superficial and understanding nuanced campaign issues. Now are you getting the connection to Trump?Or, as Dr. L nnqvist suggested: One possible reason for the greater influence of looks on right-wing constituents could be that they are less informed. Previous research has also shown that conservative voters have a more concrete, perhaps less sophisticated way of thinking. That is probably why the nation is in much better hands with Democratic presidents. It also might show why Democrats have a harder time winning. Our views are much more complex, as is our taste in candidates. Republicans campaign on bumper sticker slogans and Democrats campaign on issues. It s much easier to rally people around bumper sticker slogans than around complicated ideas.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 31, 2017"

Another source weighed in to say that the committee communicated that it is  not receptive  to Flynn s request  at this time. The senior congressional official added that Flynn s lawyer had conveyed the offer of testimony in exchange for immunity from prosecution to the Justice Department.Alleged president Donald Trump tweeted this morning:Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J.

Trump. Or, the evidence already collected on Flynn is damning and they don t need to make a deal   the latter of which is possible.Flynn was fired after lying about speaking with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Obama-era sanctions. From there, things got worse for Flynn. He also met with Kislyak for about 20 minutes at Trump Tower in December. Just one week later, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work he did before the 2016 election that  could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. In a statement Thursday, Flynn s lawyer Robert Kelner said no  reasonable person  would get questioned in  such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurance against unfair prosecution. However, in 2016, Flynn was seen at a Trump rally leading  Lock her up!  chants then saying that if he did  one tenth  what Hillary Clinton did, he would be in jail. In addition, on Meet the Press last year, Flynn said,  When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. Ouchies!

 Republican’s Excuse For Cutting Food Stamps: The Bible Says Unemployed ‘Shall Not Eat’,"Republican lawmakers love using the Bible to dictate their policies. They especially love using it to justify pushing spending cuts to social programs   even if it means intentionally misreading their favorite passages.In Texas, Rep. Jodey Arrington decided his support for cutting parts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program needed a bit of New Testament spin. How does one defend taking the food out of mouths of hungry people using the Bible? By cherrypicking this quote: If a man will not work, he shall not eat. During a debate on whether or not Republicans will further gut SNAP benefits, Arrington cited the biblical verse in response to a Jewish anti-hunger group pleading with Congress not to do something so foolish as to further dismantle food stamps. He probably thought he was being pretty clever.Arrington isn t the first to use the line. It s extremely popular with conservatives. So popular, in fact, that the Daily Kos once devoted an entire article to debunking the misinterpretation of the quote.What s important to understand is working was secondary in this context, this is not so much a moral decree about work, the main message is a warning not to take advantage of the Christian obligation to feed the hungry, especially if you are screwing up the church and community tasked with doing that by behaving like a twelve year-old socialite.In other words, the real meaning is to judge a man by his heart, not by his employment status. And as the Washington Post points out, in today s economy, being  unemployed  doesn t mean lazy, unmotivated, or being a leech. As the economy continues to separate between the  haves  and the  have-nots,  finding employment can be hard.The verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to, said theologians from several denominations who spoke to The Post. There is a perception, among some voters and lawmakers, that many adult SNAP recipients are exactly this sort of  freeloader. But policy experts say that is not the case. Many unemployed adults on SNAP simply cannot work, they say. Those include the mentally ill, the borderline disabled and veterans.Here s economist Justin Wolfers putting the sad reality of America s employment into a stunning graph:It takes a certain kind of mind to look at these trends and conclude that tax cuts for the top 1% are an urgent national priority. pic.twitter.com/6s9Jwr0a8w  Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 31, 2017Arrington has both biblical and economic reasons to doubt his own reasoning. Instead, his real ideology   the Church of Conservative Magical Thinking   led him to ignore it all in favor of more cuts to the poor to benefit the very richest in the country.And as if voters needed yet another reminder of why elections matter: Arrington has only been on the job two months. He was voted into office this year. He barely moved into his office and already he s going after the most disadvantaged people in his district. Hats off to his efficiency, but then, institutionalized cruelty often is.Featured image via the Washington Post",News,"March 31, 2017"
" Ex-Intel Official Weighs In On Flynn Immunity With Some Really, REALLY Bad News For Trump (VIDEO)","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn gave Donald Trump something to worry about last night, when he announced that he would testify on the Trump campaign s possible ties to Russia in exchange for immunity. As more experts weigh in on this, it s not looking good for Trump at all. According to a former top intelligence official, the only way Flynn will get the immunity he s seeking is if he gives up Trump.Jeremy Bash, former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee and the ex-chief of staff for both the CIA and Department of Defense, weighed in on Flynn in an interview for MSNBC: For the Justice Department to agree to give somebody like him immunity, it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain. Who is higher up in the food chain, higher than the national security adviser? There s really only one person, and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top. As of right now, Flynn s offer to testify for immunity has not been accepted by investigators, which makes Bash wonder, Immunity from what? What is he in jeopardy of being prosecuted for?  Bash advised that Flynn could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act for getting classified briefings for the Trump campaign. Bash said: That is a major felony, and that is essentially treason. It would not surprise me at all if what the prosecutors said to Flynn s lawyers is,  We haven t reached any conclusions on the Russian matter, but we have your guy dead to rights for not registering under the laws requiring registration as a foreign agent and second of conspiring to engage in kidnapping   you better come in and make a deal.' Bash made sure to reiterate that investigators will not accept Flynn s offer unless he gave up information about crimes Trump had committed. Bash said: You can only give somebody immunity, full immunity, if it s worth it. They have to believe it s worth it in this case.

 Trump Gets Smacked Down After His Immensely Stupid Flynn Immunity Tweet (TWEETS),"Last year, in an effort to demonize Hillary Clinton staffers, Trump ally Michael Flynn famously said that immunity means  you ve probably committed a crime    a quote that is now coming back to bite him in his ass now that he is begging for immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against Donald Trump.What Flynn did or the extent of his crimes is still a mystery as is what Flynn knows   but you don t ask for immunity unless you re ready to give up something big (like the President of the United States). Trump, still running scared, tweeted his support of Flynn in this  witch hunt. Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017Now, Trump may call the Russia investigation a witch hunt   especially now that his people are beginning to roll over on him   but the consensus of 17 intelligence agencies is that Vladimir Putin personally spearheaded a massive fake news, propaganda, and hacking operation with the goal of helping Trump win. Flynn, a retroactively-registered foreign agent, was fired for his specious contacts with Russian oligarchs.Trump s house is burning down, and the internet is rejoicing:@realDonaldTrump You and Flynn said that anyone involved with Hillary asking for immunity meant they were guilty.  Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) March 31, 2017@realDonaldTrump You don't ask for immunity unless you're guilty, and the FBI won't grant it unless there's a bigger fish to fry.You're the fish.

MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 31, 2017 For the Justice Department to agree to give somebody like him immunity, it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain,  former chief of staff for both the CIA and Department of Defense and former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee, Jeremy Bash, told MSNBC after news broke that Flynn had been flipped:  Who is higher up in the food chain, higher than the national security adviser? There s really only one person, and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top. Flynn and Trump have both said that immunity is an indicator of guilt. By their own admission, Flynn is guilty   and there aren t exactly many people Flynn could give up aside from Trump.

 Trump Scandal EXPLODES As Flynn’s Own Words On Immunity Come Back To Bite Him In The Ass (VIDEO),"Much like the incompetent POTUS they are working under, many members of the Trump administration have said things in the past that have come back to haunt them. And now, a new discovery about General Michael Flynn, who resigned from his position as National Security Adviser, is likely going to result in the crumbling of the Trump administration.Last night, it was reported that Flynn was asking for immunity in exchange for testimony on Russia   and a few comments he made last September came to light, which certainly will not be helping his case (or Trump s).Apparently, last year on Meet The Press, Flynn made some remarks about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta regarding immunity, which now make him seem incredibly guilty. Flynn said: Yeah, so a couple things, the very last thing that John Podesta just said is no individual too big to jail, that should include people like Hillary Clinton. I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity, to include her former Chief of Staff. When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. So you know, I don t know how he can sit there and say something like that with all the, the things that have been going around, just swirling around Hillary Clinton with her email. Yes, he said,  When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. Flynn has practically closed the case on himself with that statement. You can watch Flynn s past self basically ruin his future below:Flynn s counsel, Robert Kelner, has released a statement saying that Flynn  has a story to tell  and tried to make a case for why Flynn would seek immunity. Kelner wrote: He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution. Statement from Flynn s atty seems to acknowledge seeking immunity, explaining it s necessary in  highly politicized, witch hunt environment  pic.twitter.com/IH7ZVLwLnw  Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) March 30, 2017Considering the position Flynn is in right now, his previous statements certainly seem shady and carry some weight.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 31, 2017"
 Intel Committee Member: ‘Innocent People Don’t Ask For Immunity’ (VIDEO),"Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.  What we have here is a pattern of deceit with Michael Flynn. It s not forgetfulness,  the congressman replied.You can watch the entire interview below, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Noam Chomsky Warns Of ‘Staged Terrorist Attack’ If Enough People Turn On Trump,"Noam Chomsky has warned us of how dangerous Donald Trump is since the beginning of his campaign. His prediction that Trump would endanger the entire planet by ignoring climate change was confirmed this week when he signed an executive order rolling back President Obama s environmental protections. Now, Chomsky has another warning and it is downright terrifying.Speaking to Alternet, Chomsky said that it is just a matter of time before all of Trump s supporters realize what fraud they actually voted for. I think that sooner or later the white working-class constituency will recognize, and in fact, much of the rural population will come to recognize, that the promises are built on sand. There is nothing there,  the noted scholar said.Chomsky then explained that if Trump s approval ratings falls low enough, we could end up seeing a  staged terrorist attack. I think that we shouldn t put aside the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act, which can change the country instantly. A few days later, in an interview with Truthout, Chomsky expanded on what he meant. He explained that Trump could reach a point of sheer desperation to boost his public approval ratings. A terrorist attack would be one way he could try to do that.Chomsky again said that Trump s supporters are waking up and realizing that he lied to them about absolutely everything. Sooner or later, his supporters will turn their backs on him. If that happens, we can expect that the Trump-Bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to American security (or if there is one, exploiting it). Or, perhaps, scapegoating the most vulnerable: immigrants, Muslims, welfare recipients (one of Reagan s disgusting techniques), and other available targets,  Chomsky explained.  That could turn very ugly. It could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist Bertram Gross predicted 30 years ago. Or worse. If Chomsky s prediction is correct and Trump ever did try to stage or exploit an attack, it certainly wouldn t be the first time in history this scenario had played out. A perfect example of this is the Vietnam War.In 1964, the USS Maddox was allegedly attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin by the North Vietnamese. This is the incident responsible for officially kicking off the Vietnam War. However, documents released in 2005 and 2006 show that this supposed attack never even happened.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Joe Biden Dishes The Real Dirt On GOP Senators Who Refused To Confirm Merrick Garland,"About eight years ago, right about the time a *gasp* black man won the presidency, Republicans chose to stop governing and become known only as the party of destruction obstruction.During the eight years Republicans were holding their collective breaths until they turned orange, they managed to block a lot of pretty common sense legislation, like infrastructure investment and protecting military personnel from losing their children while fighting GOP wars. The most egregious example of GOP obstructionism, though, was toward President Obama s third Supreme Court Pick, Merrick Garland.Joe Biden, in a speech at the newly minted University of Pennsylvania Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, said he spoke to a lot of the Senators and several confessed to him that not giving Garland the up or down vote was a mistake, but they went along with it for the worst possible reason. I call 17 Republicans and say,  You know better,  Biden said Thursday.  Nine of them said to me,  You re right Joe, but I can t do anything about it because if I do the Koch brothers or somebody is going to drop $5 million into my race and I ll lose my primary. Source: PoliticoBiden s solution I something that most of us can agree upon, get money out of politics: You want to change American politics tomorrow? Pass public financing of elections,  Biden said.Republicans actually blamed Biden for their refusal to confirm Garland. They blamed the  Biden rule,  which supposedly said that they shouldn t confirm a lifetime appointment in an election year. Republicans are wrong. Biden did say that election years are contentious times to make a lifetime appointment, but he also said that confirming after the election is just fine. Some will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing more than an attempt to save a seat on the court in the hopes that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it. But that would not be our intention, Mr. President, if that were the course we were to choose in the Senate   to not consider holding hearings until after the election. Instead, it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.

 BOMBSHELL: Senate Intel Committee Hearing Reveals FRIGHTENING Extent Of Russia’s Meddling,"While the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into Russia s interference in our political process is a mess, the Senate Intelligence Committee is busily working together to conduct their own investigation in as impartial a manner as possible. And today s open hearing revealed a kicker: Russia s meddling with the U.S. government did not stop with the 2016 election.It s actually still going on.Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said: This past week we observed social media campaigns targeting speaker of the House Paul Ryan hoping to foment further unrest amongst US democratic institutions. He went on to tell the Senate Intel panel this: They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season   and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed. Sen. Rubio, in my opinion, you anecdotally suffered from these efforts. CNN acknowledges that today s hearing may well not be anything like as explosive as James Comey s statement to the House that the FBI is, in fact, investigating Trump for possible collusion with Russia during the election. However, this hearing is focused on Russia s disinformation campaign, which vice-chairman Mark Warner said was a deliberate attempt to undermine our elections.Yesterday, both Warner and Richard Burr, the committee s chairman, said that the committee had an unprecedented number of documents from Congress   Gang of Eight,  which usually severely restricts access to just such information. The Senate Intel Committee is busy trying to learn as much as it can before it calls in high-profile witnesses such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and even Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn.They have a list of 20 witnesses they plan to call in so far, but they haven t set dates as to when those witnesses will come in. With Watts  testimony today, though, things could get very interesting very quickly over in the Senate.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
" BREAKING: Michael Flynn Agrees To Testify On Russia In Exchange For Immunity, Trump Is F*cked (DETAILS)","You know how people have been wondering if Michael Flynn has been turned? Well, the Wall Street Journal confirms that Trump s former national security advisor has agreed to testify before Congress in exchange for just one little thing full immunity from prosecution.Just after news broke that an associate of Mr. Flynn s was one of Trump stooge Devin Nunes  sources for the specious secretly-gathered information with which the alleged Trump investigation leader found himself after a middle-of-the-night rendezvous on White House grounds, news broke that Flynn is ready to talk:Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump s former national security adviser, has told the Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional officials investigating the Trump campaign s potential ties to Russia that he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.As an adviser to Mr. Trump s presidential campaign, and later one of Mr. Trump s top aides in the White House, Mr. Flynn was privy to some of the most sensitive foreign-policy deliberations of the new administration and was directly involved in discussions about the possible lifting of sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama administration.It seems like Mr. Flynn has been naughty with the Russians, but whatever information he has is something he considers to be of much higher value. While we of course do not yet know what secrets Flynn is currently keeping about the Trump administration s collusion with Russia, it seems safe to assume that this is news The Donald does not want to get out.Naturally, the internet is loving this new development:Michael Flynn should probably stay away from ledges, balconies, pie shops, the back seats of cars, swimming pools, bridges, taco trucks  Wil Wheaton (@wilw) March 30, 2017Flynn just asked for a deal.

" Turncoat Democrats Break Ranks, Back Trump On Stolen SCOTUS Seat (DETAILS)","When one votes for someone with a (D) next to their name, we expect certain things. Namely, in these troubling political times, that they will oppose the bigoted and disturbingly authoritarian Trump agenda at every turn. The problem is, though, that there are Democrats sitting in Congress right now who are acting more like Republicans than Democrats. The most infamous of such figures is one Senator Joe Manchin (DINO-WV). We ve already reported on how Manchin is a complete turncoat who should simply turn in his (D) for an (R) and stop fooling his voters into thinking he s some kind of liberal, because he isn t. Manchin is anti-gay, anti-choice, pro-gun, and pro-coal. Therefore, he is certainly no Democrat in the modern sense of the word, and it should come as no surprise that he is one of two DINOS in the Senate who has announced that he will vote for the Supreme Court nominee to fill the seat that the obstructionist Republicans stole from President Obama. The other turncoat on this issue is Heidi Heitkamp (D- ND).The Hill reports that Heitcamp says of Trump s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch: After doing my due diligence by meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation. Heitcamp went on to say that Gorsuch is balanced, meticulous, and [a] well respected jurist who understands the rule of law. She obviously coordinated with Manchin to make this traitorous announcement, as it came just minutes after Manchin said of his own voting in favor of Gorsuch via Twitter: I will vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.:Luckily, there is already an organization that is actively working to deal with DINOs like Manchin and Heitkamp. Called We Will Replace You, the group is making sure to primary  Democrats  who refuse to oppose the Trump agenda and his disastrous nominees. While any Democrat is better than a Republican, these people need to stick to their guns and do what is right, not what they are being pressured to do by the Trump White House, the red state voters, and the Republicans in Congress. If they refuse to do their jobs on behalf of the Democrats who put them in Congress, they should be primaried   and if the good people at We Will Replace you have their way, all of these  Democrats  who are voting across the aisle will be primaried in 2018.Remember folks   there are plenty of people hiding behind a (D) who are in no way Democrats.

 Devin Nunes’ Credibility Is Officially SHATTERED – New York Times Reveals The Scope Of His Lies,"When Devin Nunes went running to Trump with information that Trump s transition team was caught up in surveillance, he probably didn t think he d get caught in his lies. He probably didn t think that anybody would look into his claim that, while yes, he visited the White House, he absolutely did not get his info from White House staffers. The New York Times did, and now Nunes  entire world is cracking around him.Two of his sources were, in fact, White House staffers with not-insignificant positions. One was Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director of intelligence for the National Security Council who was brought on board by the one and only disgraced Michael Flynn.The other was Michael Ellis, a national security lawyer working in the White House Counsel s office. Ellis once served as a staffer for the House Intelligence Committee.So it s not like Nunes got his info from two low-level, no-name staffers who may or may not know anything real. He got it from high-level security officials within the White House, and now his credibility is shot to hell.The sources who spoke to The New York Times did so on the condition of anonymity, but they did say that the reports that Ellis and Cohen-Watnick were looking at pretty much matched what Nunes said they were. Nunes has insisted from the beginning of the House s Russia investigation that the real problem is who s leaking information, and why he could identify some of the people in the intelligence reports, and not the possibility of high treason.But now that we know he lied about where his sources came from, we have to wonder where his loyalties lie and whether he himself is guilty of treason.While the House Intelligence Committee remains stalled due to Nunes feeling more obligated to Trump than he does to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee is plugging smoothly on with theirs. At the bare minimum, Nunes needs to recuse himself from this investigation. He really ought to resign his post entirely, though.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Pennsylvania Republican Makes Dumbest Claim Yet About Cause Of Climate Change,"Oh. My. God. The stupid, it burns.Anybody who actually paid attention in science class in school are going to have a collective WTF moment when they learn what one Pennsylvania Republican said about the cause of climate change.As we all know by now, Donald Trump signed an executive order reversing every action President Obama took to fight and reverse climate change, a move that has horrified scientists around the globe.But just as cringe-worthy is what Scott Wagner told a group of county officials on Tuesday. Wagner is a GOP state senator who wants to be Pennsylvania s next governor. Unlike Donald Trump, he acknowledges that climate change is real. However, his view on what causes climate change is far different than what any actual scientist has concluded.According to Wagner, climate change is happening because of two different reasons. First, he claimed that it s happening because of body heat. Seriously. We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can. Humans have warm bodies but it s not our body heat that is causing climate change. It s all the pollution we harmful gases we expel into the atmosphere like methane and carbon dioxide. Also, reversing climate action is not  doing the best we can.  Ending the fight against climate change threatens our country, especially our coastlines, which will likely end up under water unless we do something fast to prevent sea level rise caused by climate change.But then Wagner suggested another cause for climate change and this one makes it clear that Republicans need to pick up a f*cking science book. I haven t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year   you know, the rotation of the earth,  Wagner said.  We re moving closer to the sun. Again, this is a guy who wants to occupy the top government office in Pennsylvania.And Wagner is absolutely wrong.As Huffington Post reports,Contrary to what Wagner said, the earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. And it may come as a surprise to him that the United States and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere experience winter when the earth s yearly orbit brings it closest to the sun.Furthermore, Wagner made it sound like the Earth s orbit around the sun is decaying. But it definitely is not decaying. If anything, the sun would become a red giant and swallow the Earth. And that probably won t happen for millions of years long after climate change kills us all because Republicans like Donald Trump and Scott Wagner deny climate change and its cause.After his embarrassing remarks went viral, Wagner released a statement somewhat acknowledging that humans have contributed to climate change. I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that. However, the real question isn t is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it. I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy. The problem is that climate change will do more to hurt our economy than the measures employed to stop it ever will. One would think saving the planet would be the number one priority. But as usual, Republicans are thinking more about the wallets of billionaires.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Trump Threatens To ‘Change Libel Laws’ To Sue People Who Criticize Him In Twitter Meltdown,"Here s another hole in the leaky ship that is the argument Trump shouldn t be taken  literally  when he makes threats. Trump has circled back to his campaign promise to make changes to libel laws that would allow him to go after journalists and news organizations which publish things he doesn t like. He held out for less than three months.Trump s rediscovered love of censorship comes on the heels of several straight days of Trump freaking out about the New York Times reporting on his various scandals. And it s probably no coincidence that Trump is reconsidering press freedom right as his approval rating hits historic lows (the worst since Nixon was impeached and a record low for any president at this stage in office).In a culmination of Trump s rant against the New York Times, he called for a change in libel laws and used an article written by the New York Post   a right-leaning daily owned by Rupert Murdoch   to pretend his troubles are due to the  liberal media  and not his own incompetence.The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws? https://t.co/QIqLgvYLLi  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017The article shows how thoroughly unserious it is just three sentences in when it repeats the lie that the New York Times  apologized  to readers for being so biased against Trump. The paper did no such thing. The only other person who routinely suggests that it did is none other than Trump himself. The relationship between the New York Post and Donald Trump is an orange-painted echo chamber.Trump s belief that he can pass libel laws to restrict what the press says about him is terrifying, but not original. He made similar remarks during the campaign. Here s Trump channeling a dictator in February 2016: One of the things I m going to do if I win, and I hope we do and we re certainly leading. I m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they re totally protected. As the old adage goes, he told us who he was, we should have believed him.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 ‘He Feels Great’: Spicer Says Trump Not Concerned Taxpayers Pay For Mar-a-Lago Trips,"Amateur president Donald Trump isn t concerned in the least about the rising costs associated with his regular trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during a press briefing on Wednesday.A reporter asked if Trump has  any concerns about the pushback  from Florida residents and taxpayers about the costs of his trips there. No, he feels great,  Spicer replied.Spicer tried to defend Trump by saying that his boss stayed in Washington, D.C., last weekend and said that the alleged president plans to remain in town this weekend as well, according to MSN.Trump has spent at least five weekends at Mar-a-Lago since his inauguration only nine weeks ago. The former reality show star repeatedly criticized former President Barack Obama for going on golf outings and/or taking vacations. However, if Trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace, he is set to outspend President Obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under one year. Spicer, however, explained recently that it s alright for Trump to go on golf trips but not Obama because the current occupant of the White House conducts meetings while he s golfing.Business owners near Mar-a-Lago are going broke because of Trump s frequent visits. The cost of Trump s visits to the area is costing the state a ton of money. That means, like the wall, the taxpayers are footing the bill.Travel and security costs associated with the trips to his resort is through the roof. On top of that, this is a burden for the Secret Service.In 2015, Trump said that if elected, he would,  rarely leave the White House because there s so much work to be done.

 CNN Host STUNNED As Trump Voters Expose Just How Stupid They Are In Interview (VIDEO),"Much like Donald Trump himself, it s hard to tell what kinds of insane things might happen during an interview with the people who support the incompetent POTUS. CNN s Alisyn Camerota learned this the hard way on Thursday morning when she interviewed a few Trump voters about how they thought he was doing after his several weeks in office. The experience may have left a permanent scar.Despite having the failures, investigations and exposed lies, this focus group of Trump voters gave Trump an  A  grade   all but 1 voter in the group of 6 had the balls to give Trump a  B  because he refused to give out the highest grade. That voter, Billy Baer, said: It was like people were laughing in his face   literally laughing in his face   about the prospect of him being elected. He got elected, and we don t know, as far as the votes and fraud and everything else. My assumption is that he probably would have been elected by a higher number than what the results actually showed. While giving a clearly failing and highly unpopular POTUS an A or B is puzzling in itself, the real shocking moment came when Camerota challenged the Trump supporters on Trump s claim that millions of people had voted illegally in the election. This is where Baer insisted he saw busloads of people from out of state coming into New Hampshire to vote. Camerota questioned this obviously bullsh*t claim and asked: When you say you ve seen it, do you mean dozens or do you mean 3 million? There s a difference. Baer then admitted he hadn t seen 3 million illegal voters, even though this has been the number Trump s been touting despite having no evidence. Baer replied: Extrapolating, based on the number I ve seen with my own eyes, busloads of people coming in   whether they re illegal, meaning they came into the country illegally, or they re illegal voters   they came over from Massachusetts into New Hampshire. When Camerota asked Baer just how he d seen  busloads and busloads , another Trump supporter chimed in to deliver the final blow of insanity. Josh Youssef jumped in and said,  Who cares, though? , solidifying that the truth and facts do not matter at all to anyone who supports Trump. Camerota was visibly stunned and said: I care. Just to be clear, you saw it with your own eyes, busloads and busloads of people coming from somewhere other than New Hampshire to vote. You saw that? Youssef tried to defend Trump and said: I ve seen cars coming in from out of state that are full, with out-of-state plates   I live right across the street from the polling place in my ward. And not surprisingly, Baer s claims also didn t hold up. He eventually said: Yeah, I guess that I can t cite the busloads that I ve seen and where I ve seen them, but on television I ve seen it. Well, we know that Trump also gets all of his  facts  from television   the mostly false Fox News to be exact   so this makes perfect sense.

 The CREEPY Way Pence’s Religion Demands He Treat Women Will Make You SICK (DETAILS),"Mike Pence is a devout Evangelical Christian. There s nothing wrong with that; after all, that s what the First Amendment is for. However, it seems that Trump s vice president takes his piety to a whole new, incredibly creepy level. First, there is the way he treats his wife.Reports of a dinner Pence had with state senators while he was still Governor of Indiana are most alarming. Apparently, during the dinner, it was revealed that Pence actually calls his wife  mother.  It seems that at first, people thought it was a cute joke or something, but then came to realize that he was completely serious. Pence reportedly yelled down the table at his wife repeatedly during the meal. From Rolling Stone:Gov. Pence shouted to his wife, Karen, his closest adviser, at the other end of the table. Mother, Mother, who prepared our meal this evening? The legislators looked at one another, speaking with their eyes: He just called his wife  Mother. Maybe it was a joke, the legislator reasoned. But a few minutes later, Pence shouted again. Mother, Mother, whose china are we eating on? Mother Pence went on a long discourse about where the china was from. A little later, the legislators stumbled out, wondering what was weirder: Pence s inability to make conversation, or calling his wife  Mother  in the second decade of the 21st century.As if that weren t bad enough, it seems that there are even creepier rules with regards to how Pence treats women other than his wife. In fact, according to New York Magazine, Pence is not allowed to dine alone with any woman who is not his wife, Karen Pence. Supposedly, Karen Pence is her husband s  gut check  and  prayer warrior,  and is therefore rarely away from her husband. Unsurprisingly, though, we never hear her speak. Perhaps she is not allowed to. Hell, Pence won t even go to any sort of gathering where there is booze on the menu unless Karen is right there.So, if Pence is not allowed to be in a room with any woman who is not his wife, then how on earth does he do government business if the adviser happens to be a woman? Does his wife get to be in the Situation Room? Does she get top level clearances? Are they allowed to use  religious liberty  as the reason for such accommodations? Time will only tell. What we do know is that Mike Pence and his wife get creepier by the day, and that is very bad for America.The only consolation is that it sure as hell explains a lot   but the more we learn about these creepy people, the scarier America s situation becomes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Rep. Ted Lieu Has A Response To Sean Spicer’s Daily Lies; It’s GLORIOUS (TWEET),"Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) is one of the loudest and most steadfast members of #THERESISTANCE in Congress. He has called Donald Trump an  evil man  over the GOP s cruel approach to healthcare, and has even suggested that president #45 could use some mental health treatment. Now, Rep. Lieu has posted a video to Twitter in which he doesn t speak at all, but doesn t need to.Lieu s latest target is White House Lying Mouthpiece Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Of course, Spicer is in the limelight right now because of his treatment of veteran reporter April Ryan during Tuesday s press briefing. He was condescending, he lied to her face, and basically treated her like she was beneath him. Rep. Lieu s answer? To print out a sign and tape it to his office name plate that identifies the space as an  #Alternativefacts Free Zone.  In the two second video that he posted to Twitter, he simply shakes his head with regards to how he feels about anything Spicer has to say:This is my response to pretty much everything White House @PressSec @SeanSpicer says during his press briefings. cc: @AprilDRyan pic.twitter.com/OlnCbpvVs8  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 29, 2017This is the only appropriate response to anything coming from Sean Spicer, or any of the other lying excuses for White House officials at this point.

 Black Caucus Just Broke It Down For Paul Ryan: Time To Get Rid Of Nunes As Intel Committee Chair,"The Congressional Black Caucus just broke it down for House Speaker Paul Ryan, explaining to him in no uncertain terms that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) obviously can t be trusted and needs to be removed as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. This action is necessary in order to meet the public s expectation that Congress conducts an impartial investigation into a matter that threatens the core of our democracy,  the CBC wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. Congressman Nunes  recent actions have caused him to lose the confidence of members of his committee, and, more importantly, the American people, and he can no longer be trusted with the information that the committee receives. Some lawmakers are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Others, like the CBC, are calling on Ryan to remove him as intel chair altogether. The caucus is also demanding that a special  bipartisan commission  be formed to handle the probe into Russia s election meddling and Trump s possible collusion. Congress must create an independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about any and all Trump-Russia connections and collusion,  the statement reads.  The American people want and deserve to know if their government has been compromised by the Kremlin. The Black Caucus is not alone. Democrats have been calling on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election. He landed himself in hot water last week when he decided it would be a great idea to announce that intelligence on Donald Trump had been gathered accidentally while monitoring other people of interest, such as the Russian ambassador, without bothering to mention it to the committee first.All hell broke loose when Nunes then decided he should brief Trump on the matter. To make matters worse, it later came out that he secretly visited the White House the night before the announcement was made, leading some to question where his information came from in the first place.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 This Man Has The PERFECT Response To House GOP’s Attempt To Destroy Internet Privacy,"Congress has been working on rolling back an Obama-era rule that protected us from having our internet histories bought, sold, and broadcast; and people are understandably upset considering the GOP s ongoing pretense that privacy is everything. The rule hadn t gone into effect, but it would have given us more control over what our ISPs can do with our information than we currently have.The GOP doesn t want that rule to go into effect, and Max Temkin, one of the founders of the party game  Cards Against Humanity,  has made a vow that Congress would be wise to heed, since Temkin has an awful lot of money:If this shit passes I will buy the browser history of every congressman and congressional aide and publish it. cc @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/cOL3mx6JuG  Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) March 27, 2017It s a strong,  in your face, how do you like it?  move. The point that Temkin is trying to make here is that, if Congressional Republicans are willing to allow companies to buy and sell our information, compromising our privacy, then they should know exactly what that feels like. The ISPs and the GOP both feel that this restriction was unfair, given that it wouldn t have applied to major websites like Google and Facebook.So, of course, we should get rid of this rule instead of leveling the playing field and preventing Google and Facebook (and other sites) from likewise collecting and selling our data. Industry groups framed their argument like so: It set out an overbroad definition of sensitive data that doesn t apply to non-ISP s collecting as much or more personal data online. And as we all know, privacy shouldn t be about who collects information, it should be about what information is collected and how it is used. The truth is that Republicans have been getting a lot of money from the telecom industry, and they only care about privacy when it doesn t adversely affect their handlers. Maybe if they re the first to have their data sold and exposed, they ll think twice about their selective brand of privacy advocacy.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Donald Trump ‘SHOCKED’ A Group Of Women Have Heard Of One Of The Most Famous Women In History (VIDEO),"For some reason, Donald Trump decided to speak to a group of women at a women s empowerment event on Wednesday, on one of the final days of Women s History Month. It didn t go well.First he bragged about the number of women in his cabinet. There are six women. Out of 24. That s 25 percent. Less than half of what would be representative of the nation as a whole. It s also the whitest and most male cabinet since Ronald Reagan.It got worse. Trump went on to name women, famous women, although there s no indication that Trump knew why many of them were famous. The first part wasn t soooooo bad: Since the very beginning, women have driven, and I mean, each generation of Americans, towards a more free and more prosperous future,  Trump said.  These patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams, right? Who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women. She was very much a pioneer in that way. We ve been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman who escaped slavery. And went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first in the underground railroad and then as a spy for the union army. She was very, very courageous, believe me. Source: Raw StoryIt very quickly became clear he was out of his intellectual element when he completed that thought with:Around we ve had leaders like Susan B. Anthony. Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony? I m shocked that you ve heard of her   who dreamed of a much more fair and equal future and an America where women themselves as she said helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers, and that s what s happening more and more. Of course, it s not shocking at all that a group of women have in fact heard of the suffragette and all around social justice warrior. There was even a coin with her face on it, but to be fair, it s doubtful Trump carries cash. Other people pay all of his bills.Trump, though, had clearly never heard of Anthony, at least before someone briefed him right before the event.Here s the video:Perhaps Trump s handlers (whoever they are) need to remind the orange dictator that he should never, ever speak to people who aren t white and male.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Married GOP Lawmaker And Trump Campaign Member BUSTED In Hotel With Teenage Boy,"As if Donald Trump needs help delegitimizing his party, a senior member of his campaign in Oklahoma, state Senator Ralph Shortey, was forced to resign after being caught in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male prostitute.In true Trump style, Shortey tried to spin the encounter as him just helping the kid earn some money for his Spring Break by letting the kid earn his way with  sexual stuff. In online messages, he told him:  I m gonna f**k you like a good little boy if you keep calling me daddy. He also referred to having sex with the teen s  boy p*ssy, baby boy .Source: Pink NewsAccording to court documents, Shortey was reported by a friend of the boy, who saw him getting into an SUV. The friend followed them to the hotel room, where he saw the boy enter with a strange man. The friend called the teen s father, who called the police.While the age of consent in Oklahoma is only 16, having sex with a prostitute under 18 is something else altogether. Shortey has been charged with engaging in child prostitution, engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church and transporting a minor for prostitution. All the charges are felonies. He s out on $100,000 bail.Here s the video:Shortey s statement following resignation fell short of admitting to his crimes, instead calling them  a distraction. Earlier today, I submitted my resignation, effective immediately, to the President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, as well as to Governor Fallin. I thank the constituents of Senate District 44 for the opportunity they provided to serve. Because I take that responsibility seriously, I recognize that the charges against me are a distraction to their interests and the remaining legislative session, which should serve all Oklahomans. My resignation is evidence of my respect for public service and the duties of our elected officials. I ask for the privacy of my family   my wife and four daughters   as I defend myself of these charges.Source: KFOR ",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump’s Approval Rating Makes SHOCKING Change With His Own Supporters (IMAGE),"Donald Trump likes to whine about any poll that doesn t show him in a favorable light, calling the data  biased  or  dishonest    but here s one poll that he cannot ignore.A new Politico/Morning Consult poll covering numbers as recent as March 24-25 shows that Trump s approval ratings are plummeting   even among his own supporters. Trump has been shown to be failing in more balance polls, which is no surprise   but to see his support dwindling so quickly among Republicans is quite shocking. According to the data, Trump s ratings are now as follows: Overall, 38 percent of voters strongly disapprove of Trump, compared to only 23 percent who strongly approve. To make matters even worse for Trump, this national tracking poll had a tendency to lean pro-Trump, which made the findings far higher than a more balanced poll like Gallup s most recent data, which shows Trump s approval rating at a pathetic 38%.It appears as though Trump s disastrous failure with the American Health Care Act (Trumpcare) had an extremely negative impact on his approval rating, which fell 6% points among his own supporters. The Politico/Morning Consult poll reported: The decline in Trump s approval rating was sharper among Republicans and independents than among Democrats. In the latest survey, 81 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of independents approve of the job Trump is doing. A week prior, 85 percent of GOP voters and 44 percent approved. And among those who self-identified as Trump voters last year, the president s approval rating shrunk from 90 percent last week to 84 percent this week. However, it s not just Trump s health care debacle that is impacting his numbers so much   his Russia scandal is also working against him: Twenty-nine percent of voters call Russia an  enemy  of the U.S., and 30 percent say it is an unfriendly nation. Only 7 percent call Russia an  ally,  and another 22 percent say it s friendly but not an ally. Five weeks ago, voters were divided evenly on whether Russia was friendly toward the United States. Trump was an extremely unpopular president to begin with, and he has failed to redeem or prove himself to the American people. In fact, he hasn t even tried   and his supporters are catching on. They ve practically disappeared and seem ashamed to defend him after his corruption, humiliating behavior, and broken campaign promises have come to light. With numbers this pathetic, Trump and his policies don t stand a chance.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump Official Accidentally Leaks Plan To Steal Land From Mexico For Border Wall,"Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto may not be too happy once he hears of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s plan to make that border wall thing happen. You see, the terrain on our southern border isn t exactly the most uniform thing in the universe and at times there may be complications   like the Rio Grande River.E&E News reports that Zinke told a crowd at an event held by Public Lands Council this week that the Trump administration didn t want to build the wall on American soil because it would mean handing the entire Rio Grande river to Mexico   so he just wants to take the land instead: The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall. The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall? We re not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico. And we re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river. Zinke stopped just shy of saying that we d take the land by force, but he made it pretty clear that the United States isn t going to give up the river   and Mexico isn t going to hand over land on their side to build a gigantic ugly wall on the border. First, President Trump proposed building a wall on our southern border and having Mexico pay for it. Now his administration is planning to build a wall in Mexico and have Americans pay for it,  Austin Evers, executive director of watchdog group Americans Oversight, said in a statement following the remarks.Will Trump s agenda lead us to war with one of our allies? If the administration has its way, according to Zinke, that s exactly what will happen.featured image via screengrab",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump DEVASTATED After Poll Reveals Americans Trust Media More Than Him (TWEET),"It was just this morning that Donald Trump once again tried to ignore his mounting failures and pump up his ego by trashing the press. Taking to Twitter, the undeserving POTUS bashed the New York Times (again) with yet another one of his lies. And after Trump trashed the New York Times, he posted another tweet about the  vicious  and inaccurate media:If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017However, thanks to a new poll released by Monmouth University, Trump s temper tantrums about the press are far from over, because he seems to be alone in his opinion. The Monmouth University poll revealed that thanks to Trump s numerous lies and falsehoods, Americans now view MSNBC as a more credible source than him!You can only imagine how devastating it is for Trump to realize that his attacks on  fake news  are actually working against him and HELPING networks that dare to publish the truth about him. The poll stated: Only 28% of Americans are more likely trust Trump as an information source compared to ABC news while most (53%) say they would tend to trust ABC more, with 15% saying they would trust both sides equally. When pitted against MSNBC, 33% trust Trump more while 47% trust the liberal leaning cable channel more, with 15% trusting both about equally. When pitted against Fox News, only 17% trust Trump more while 37% trust the politically conservative news outlet more, with 36% trusting both about equally. Another interesting but not surprising finding from the poll was the fact that networks like MSNBC and ABC were viewed as more credible than Fox News, which has previously been outed as the most dishonest network (which is likely why Trump cites them so much). The only area where Trump is actually succeeding in credibility is among Republicans, who tend to take Trump s nonsense as the truth. The poll reported: The story is different, though, when isolating the views of Republicans. Americans who identify as GOP partisans are more likely to have confidence in Trump over any of the news sources tested in the poll. This is especially true for MSNBC   Trump is more trusted by a 66% to 16% margin   and ABC News   Trump is more trusted by a 56% to 22% margin. The president even has a slight, although statistically insignificant, 29% to 26% trust advantage over Fox News among his fellow partisans, with 44% of Republicans saying they trust both equally as an information source. So, Trump basically screwed himself over by trying to damage the credibility of the free press. While it s somewhat satisfying to see his attacks on the media backfire, we must not forget that what Trump s ridiculous behavior has resulted in is extremely dangerous. The White House now has no credibility, which could be devastating in the event that something serious happens. No one can trust the president, and he has undermined the credibility of the government. It will take a long time to repair this and rebuild the trust of the American people.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 29, 2017"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017Trump was likely referring to a letter addressed to subscribers written by publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who acknowledged that the newspaper had underestimated Trump and the amount of support he had among conservatives.Of course, it wasn t just The New York Times that got it wrong. Multiple news outlets across the media got it wrong. Then again, maybe they were right. We ll just never know since Russia interfered in the election on Trump s behalf and FBI Director James Comey dropped an October surprise on Hillary Clinton that damaged her campaign despite the  new evidence  being worthless. After all, Trump lost the popular vote by three million votes and squeaked out one of the narrowest Electoral College wins in American history.Anyway, nowhere in the letter did Sulzberger apologize for the coverage Times reporters and journalist provided on the election and Trump s budding scandals.That s why The New York Times fired back at Trump two hours after his tweet on Wednesday morning to slam him for lying..@realdonaldtrump False, we did not apologize.

 WATCH: Conservationist Jane Goodall BLASTS Trump’s Attack On Climate Science,"Donald Trump s roll-back of actions designed to fight climate change horrified the legendary conservationist.Jane Goodall is famous for her longtime studies of apes and chimpanzees.During the 2016 campaign, Goodall put this expertise to good use by comparing Trump to the chimpanzees she researched. In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,  Goodall said.  In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position. And she was right. Trump s ape-like behavior thrilled his supporters and sent him to the White House where he has embarrassed himself and the nation so much that many Americans probably wish an actual chimpanzee had won instead of him, especially after what Trump did earlier this week.As a conservationist, Goodall has traveled the world and witnessed the effects of climate change firsthand.So when Trump signed yet another executive order to reverse rules put in in place by President Obama to slow down or reverse the effects of climate change, hr usual optimism soured.Referring to Trump s executive order as  immensely depressing,  Goodall expressed how sad it is that the United States is declining to play its part to save the world. Many of us, not just my institute but many, we ve been working really hard to create the Paris agreement and global efforts to cut emissions,  Goodall told journalists.  Thinking that the USA isn t going to play its part, such an industrial country, is really very, very sad. And it means we re going to have to work harder. Indeed, while the United States is not the only nation in the world, our influence on the international stage is critical to any agreement of between countries, especially when it comes to financial, technological, and military resources.Trump s irresponsible order to reverse our nation s involvement in fighting climate change not only threatens the rest of the world, it threatens America as well, especially our coastlines, which are in danger of being under several feet of water due to sea level rise caused by increasingly melting ice caps.Trump s beloved Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be under water in the near future if we do not act now.But Trump had adopted the conservative line that climate change is not real and that science is fake. He s a climate change denier, and Jane Goodall has zero tolerance for that stance. I would not dream of refuting the science that shows climate change is happening,  Goodall said.  It s happening everywhere. It s already having devastating effects in many parts of the world. The droughts are getting worse, flooding s getting worse. Storms, hurricanes are getting more frequent and more violent. And the main thing is unpredictability. Everywhere I go, people say,  Well it s not normally like that at this time of year. And Trump s attack on climate action is causing scientists to lose hope. There is definitely a feeling of gloom and doom among all the people I know,  Goodall continued.  If we allow this feeling of doom and gloom to continue, then it will be very, very bad. But my job is to give people hope. Bu despite her high hopes that we can push back and reinstate the climate actions, even Goodall conceded that she sees the future of our children and grandchildren  being unraveled  right before our eyes by a man who doesn t care about thing or anyone but himself. Even a chimpanzee would have more compassion.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 The Latest Delusion From Devin Nunes Will Make You SICK — This Is Exactly Why He Can’t Be Trusted,"Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation,  he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump. Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico. So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation,  Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 29, 2017"
" Fox News Just Got SLAPPED With A Racial Discrimination Lawsuit, And It’s About Damn Time","Years of racism in the workplace has finally resulted in a long overdue lawsuit against Fox News.On the same day that Fox host Bill O Reilly made an outrageously racist comment about Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and a week after news broke that Fox fired comptroller Judith Slater for making racist remarks to black employees, a racial discrimination lawsuit was formally filed against the network by two African-American women who experienced the racism firsthand.According to The New York Times,The women   Tichaona Brown, a payroll manager, and Tabrese Wright, a payroll coordinator   accused Ms. Slater of making numerous racially charged comments, including suggestions that black men were  women beaters  and that black people wanted to physically harm white people.They also said that Ms. Slater claimed that black employees mispronounced words, such as  mother,   father,   month  and  ask,  and that she urged Ms. Brown to say those words aloud in a meeting. Ms. Wright said Ms. Slater once asked if her three children were all  fathered by the same man. The lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx and the attorneys representing the two ladies are  confident  that Fox is not going to like the outcome if they go to court. We are confident that the good men and women of the Bronx will hold Fox accountable for what we believe to be its abhorrent racist conduct, reminiscent of the Jim Crow era,  they said in a joint statement.Of course, Fox News whined about the lawsuit in a statement to Raw Story.We take complaints of this nature very seriously and took prompt and effective remedial action before Ms. Brown and Ms. Wright sued in court and even before Ms. Wright complained through her lawyer. There is no place for inappropriate verbal remarks like this at Fox News. We are disappointed that this needless litigation has been filed.Frankly, it s about damn time Fox News faced a lawsuit like this. The network s record of racism and racist remarks has been atrocious over the years, especially since the election of the President Obama in 2008.Bill O Reilly and Sean Hannity have been especially guilty of being racist, yet unlike Slater, they remain employed by the network.O Reilly has even been named in sexual harassment lawsuits but Fox executives still keep paying him to run his mouth every night.Fox News is pretty much saying that it s okay if their on-air personalities are sexist and racist but it s not okay for their executives who work behind the scenes. Sounds like a double standard.But the sexism and racism at Fox News is now catching up to them as former and current employees are starting to fight back by filing lawsuits. At some point, Fox News is going to have to drag itself and their employees into the 21st century before they go broke trying to defend themselves in court.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds",News,"March 29, 2017"

Just look at all that s happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their jobs,  Clinton told the crowd, cutting into White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for the condescending attitude he had toward a reporter who shook her head as Spicy lied to her: April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question. Clinton also took aim at Trump ally, Fox News host Bill O Reilly, for his insanely racist joke about a black congresswoman s hair: One of our own California congressmen Maxine Waters was taunted with a racist joke about her hair. Too many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride. But why should we have to?  Clinton asked rhetorically.

 Makers Of Fake Planned Parenthood Baby Parts Video Slapped With 15 Felony Charges,"Two anti-abortion activists are facing 15 felony charges after they secretly filmed themselves trying to buy aborted fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. (In case you missed it, these attempts were unsuccessful because, duh. But that didn t stop them from editing this video footage and then using it to claim that the women s health provider was selling baby parts. They weren t.)State Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt on Tuesday. The Associated Press reports:The allegations say the pair filmed 14 people without permission between October 2013 and July 2015 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and El Dorado counties. One felony count was filed for each person. The 15th was for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.According to Becerra, Daleiden and Merritt created a fictitious biomedical research company, which they then lied about in order to convince representatives of Planned Parenthood to meet with them   and then they secretly recorded them without their knowledge.Daleiden claims these charges are  bogus  and are only being brought against him because of Planned Parenthood s political cronies.  Naturally. The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,  Daleiden said. (For the record, the women s health care provider has committed zero crimes.)Last April, Daleiden claimed on social media that his home had been raided by agents from the California Department of Justice who confiscated all his video footage, among other things. There had been no word on the investigation since then until the charges were filed with the San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday.In January of 2016, Daleiden and Merritt were both indicted on similar charges by a grand jury in Texas. That grand jury had originally been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, but not only did they find no wrongdoing on the part of the women s health care provider, they also ended up indicting the filmmakers for their bogus video. Unfortunately, these charges were dropped because the prosecutor said the jury had overstepped since this was not why they were convened.Featured image via Eric Kayne/Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Nunes Just Gave the Most Immature Answer When Asked If He Will Recuse Himself (VIDEO),"Trump transition team member Devin Nunes, who inexplicably is leading the congressional investigation into Trump s ties with Russia, recently got himself in a spot of trouble when he met with a source he will not reveal on the White House grounds in the middle of the night on Wednesday to obtain sketchy intel that seems intended to back Trump s claim that President Obama  tapped  his  wires. Nunes claims that he was shown U.S. surveillance documents that indicate numerous members of the Trump team were indirectly surveilled when they contacted some shady foreign people who were being investigated. Instead of taking this information, which may or may not be true as the alleged Trump investigator refuses to show his work, to his fellow investigators Nunes admits he ran straight to the main subject of the investigation.By Thursday, Nunes was scrambling to apologize for corrupting the investigation by leaking details to the guy he s supposed to be investigating amid calls for him to recuse himself. But Nunes refuses to do so despite a clear conflict of interest.On Wednesday, CNN caught up to Nunes to ask if he will recuse himself and he decided the appropriate response was that of a third-grader:This is the mentality of the people with whom we are dealing   they are like children who have been handed too much power and are f*cking evil. But really, what did we expect given that Nunes  boss regularly employs the  I know you are but what am I?  and  But teacher, he hit me too  defenses.Watch it below:Instead of recusing himself from the #TrumpRussia investigation, @DevinNunes insults and denies   just like @realDonaldTrump. #Russiagate pic.twitter.com/0NNWxeygT7  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) March 28, 2017featured image via screengrab",News,"March 28, 2017"
 April Ryan Describes In Harrowing Detail What It Feels Like To Be Abused By Sean Spicer (VIDEO),"By now, everyone is aware of the appallingly abusive way in which White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer treated American Urban Radio Correspondent April Ryan during Tuesday s White House Press briefing. All Ryan was doing was, well, HER JOB, and asking about the cloud of Russia investigations hanging over the embattled Trump Administration. This caused Sean Spicer to completely lose it, and launch into condescending, sexist, and racist attacks on Ryan.After the press availability was over, Ryan spoke with MSNBC s Katy Tur about her experience, addressing the accusation from Sean Spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts. Ryan told Tur: I don t have an agenda. We ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple, how do you change the perception problem? And it went off into this Russian dressing, no shaking my head or whatever. You cannot ignore, as a reporter, there are issues on Capitol Hill. You have investigations going. You have the head of the intel committee coming here to the White House briefing people, the president himself. I understand what Sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now. And unfortunately, I was roadkill today. No matter what Sean Spicer s job is, he had not right to treat April Ryan that way. She was just doing her job. If he can t handle tough questions, he should find another line of work. To flat-out deny all of those investigations, and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the Trump White House is a huge story is truly beyond the pale. Until they come clean about the Russia business, this will continue to be a story. The White House Press Corp would derelict in their duties if they didn t continue to press Spicer on this.Good on you for being a superb member of the Fourth Estate, Ms. Ryan. You handled Spicer s abuse with grace and dignity. Believe me, he s the one who comes out looking worse for wear on this one.Watch the video below, via Real Clear Politics:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 28, 2017"
" Trump Says He Never Makes Mistakes, Then Immediately Makes A Mistake (VIDEO)","In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes. It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House. Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong. One mistake and it s no good. But we just can t make mistakes, right? So we don t make mistakes. Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to  Ken. Go ahead, Ken. That wasn t  Ken.  That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House. He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false. Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination. His  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry, not sorry  publicity stunt. He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part. A lie as obvious as  I never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube",News,"March 28, 2017"
 WATCH: Lindsey Graham LAYS INTO Devin Nunes – Time To Let The Grownups Handle This,"Senator Lindsey Graham is on the attack after Nunes blew the credibility of the House Intel Committee s investigation into collusion with Russia. He appeared on NBC s  Today  show this morning to tell the entire world exactly what he thinks of Nunes at this point, and he didn t hold anything back: I think it s a little bizarre. There s nothing been revealed to suggest the Obama administration surveilled the Trump campaign. That s not even what Nunes is saying. He s saying there s incidental collection outside of Russia.The problem he s created is he s gone out on a lark by himself, sort of an Inspector Clouseau investigation here, trying to find some unmasking information about collection incidental with the Trump campaign and some foreign agent outside of Russia. I think the only way this can be repaired is if he tells his colleagues on the House Intelligence committee who he met with and what he saw. Graham wants Nunes to do the right thing to fix this investigation, but believes that Nunes  objectivity is now in question. Graham also says that if he s not willing to share the information he has with his panel colleagues (Republican and Democratic), then he s  lost his ability to lead. At this point, Graham says the Senate is doing a great job with its investigation and suggested that maybe it s time for the Senate to take the reins on this.Watch below:Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Trump Told Police Union To Report Cops Who Didn’t Vote For Him And It’s Uncomfortable As Hell (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, our resident Manchurian couch potato met with the head of Chicago s Fraternal Order of Police to talk about the  carnage  (as Trump calls it) in the city that prompted Trump to  send in the feds  in January. Sadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs,  Trump told union officials at the meeting.  In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise. These are painful realities that many in Washington don t want to talk about. We have seen it all over. Trump thanked the union president Dean Angelo for the support he and the union gave during the campaign and, as is custom, took a moment to tell them how much cops love him, describing the numbers in his favor among law enforcement as  extremely lopsided. Then, he said something that would be taken as a joke when uttered by most people   but not by someone who installs people in various government offices to serve as loyalty police: I m just trying to figure out the few people who voted the other way. Who are they? Who are they? Find out who they are, please, and let us know. The room filled with uncertain, muffled, uneasy laughter.Was Trump joking? Who knows? After all, ever since he came to power he has treated the act of firing and threatening anyone who disagrees with him as a regular, everyday activity.Watch this extremely uncomfortable moment below:Featured image via Chicago Tribune",News,"March 28, 2017"
 WATCH: The View HAMMERS Fox News For Ignoring Trump’s Russia Scandal,"As Donald Trump continues to take criticism from the press over his scandalous ties to Russia, the ladies of The View noticed that one network is deafeningly silent.Ever since FBI Director James Comey confirmed that Trump is being investigated for colluding with Russia during the 2016 campaign, the scandal has only widened as House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes demonstrated that he s more interested in derailing the investigation than he is in pursuing it.Nunes has canceled hearings that would have shined more light on Trump s scandal and he also went to the White House to personally inform Trump about the committee s investigation, which is highly unethical and proves that Republicans are incapable of running this investigation.Indeed, Nunes own ties to Russia and Putin have been recently revealed. As it turns out, Nunes owns part of a winery that is connected to a Russian investor who is close to Putin. Furthermore, Nunes served on Trump s transition team. So it s clear that Nunes has a lot to lose if he allows the investigation to move forward.But even though the evidence against Trump is piling up and Republicans have been caught engaging in an attempted cover-up, Fox News is not screaming about it nearly as much as they were screaming about Benghazi.The hosts of View tackled Fox, Trump, and Nunes during their show on Tuesday. And it wasn t pretty either as even the most conservative hosts on the program agreed that something smells awfully fishy.First, Whoopi Goldberg slammed Trump for calling his Russia scandal a  hoax. If it is a hoax, don t you want them to investigate and clear your name, my friend?  she quipped.Joy Behar pointed out that Trump is a  serial liar  so he has zero credibility on this issue. First of all, we know he s a committed serial liar, so when he says it s a hoax, he means it s not a hoax,  she said.Sunny Hostin, who is an attorney, chimed in by attacking Nunes for sneaking off to the White House to inform Trump on what his committee is doing and noted that Nunes could also be in trouble because he may have been caught on a wiretap talking to Russian officials since he was making calls as part of Trump s transition team. Indeed, Nunes  connections to Russia and Putin combined with his unwillingness to run a fair and unbiased investigation should force him to recuse himself and step down from the House Intelligence Committee.Then Whoopi Goldberg and Jedediah Bila teamed up to hammer Fox News. Why isn t Fox screaming about this?  Goldberg asked.  They screamed about Benghazi. She s right. Fox News constantly talked about Benghazi as if it was the scandal to beat all scandals. In the end, it was only a Republican witch hunt against Hillary Clinton and no wrongdoing was found.But Donald Trump has serious connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin and it has been proven that Russia interfered in the 2016 Election on Trump s behalf, especially after Trump asked them to continue hacking our institutions. Several of Trump s aides and closest advisers have been revealed as having significant ties to Putin, including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page. Even Trump s son-in-law took a meeting with a Russian banker who has close ties to Putin.If you have a brain right now and you re a functioning person, the word  Russia  has come up way too many times with this administration,  Bila pointed out before referencing Putin.  That name is showing up too much for me to be comfortable right now. Here s the video via YouTube:It s time for Congress to let an independent commission take over the investigation from the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes has zero credibility and he has proven that he s nothing but a Trump stooge. A special prosecutor should also be appointed tot eh investigation. Donald Trump s Russia scandal has raged on for months and it s only getting bigger and bigger despite how much Republicans have been dragging their feet. If Hillary Clinton were in the White House right now, Republicans would have triggered investigation after investigation over the tiniest hints of a scandal. But Donald Trump is embroiled in a real scandal that threatens to topple our country to Putin s advantage and Republicans are reluctant to do anything about it because it threatens their power. Not only should Trump be investigated, Republicans in Congress should be investigated for being complicit.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Fox News Host Tells Black Congresswoman To ‘Step Away From Crack Pipe’ (VIDEO),"It would appear Fox News isn t even hiding their blatant racism anymore, nor doing anything about it.Appearing on the cable  news  network, Fox regular Eric Bolling decided he would go all in and call a black Congresswoman a crack addict, and in the worst way possible.While discussing Rep.

 Trump Gets SKEWERED For Trying To Take Credit For Investment Ford Planned In 2015,"Donald Trump continues to embarrass himself in a desperate effort to prove that he s a job creator.In yet another self-serving and self-promoting post on Twitter, Trump crowed about an announcement made by Ford Motor Company that it is investing $1.2 billion in three automotive plants in Michigan that will keep and create jobs.Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017However, Ford previously planned this investment back in 2015 while President Obama was still in office.According to The Detroit News,The company said Tuesday it will invest $850 million to retool its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne for truck and SUV production; $150 million in its Romeo Engine Plant to expand capacity for several vehicles; and $200 million to build a data center at the company s Flat Rock Assembly Plant. The investments at the Michigan Assembly Plant and Romeo Engine Plant were negotiated as part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract. The investments at Flat Rock   those announced today and those announced in January   are new.In short, most of the investments Trump is praising were already going to happen as part of deal between Ford executives and the labor union, which means a labor should get the credit for helping American workers and preventing jobs from being outsourced to other countries. Trump had nothing to do with it.This isn t the first time Trump has taken credit for investments and job growth companies planned prior to him taking office.Trump also took credit for a Charter Communications announcement to create 20,000 jobs even though that plan was also made in 2015.Of course, while Trump supporters are gullible enough to believe he is responsible for these job gains, everyone else is not buying it. Twitter users made that clear in their comments.Hey @realDonaldTrump, these are all part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract.

 Undocumented Immigrant Dares Trump To Release His Taxes After Proving She Pays Hers,"Donald Trump s head is going to explode when he sees this.Back in September as the 2016 campaign raged on, Trump claimed that undocumented immigrants cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars and complained that only 5 percent to 10 percent of them pay taxes. Illegal immigration, each year, costs us between $200 billion and $300 billion,  Trump told CNN host Erin Burnett.  I don t know if anybody gives you those numbers. Probably not. There s very little, percentage-wise,  Trump said on the number of immigrants who pay taxes.  There s very little, probably 5 percent, 10 percent. Wrong.As it turns out, Trump claimed in August that the figure was around $113 billion. But Politifact rated his claim  false  after doing some research. Trump s information comes from an unreliable conservative think tank that fiercely opposes immigration. Reports from other organizations, even conservative ones, put the figure drastically lower.It also turns out that around more than half of the undocumented immigrants in this country pay more taxes than Donald Trump does. After all, just a single year of Trump s tax returns showed that he probably didn t pay a dime in federal income taxes for over a decade. Undocumented immigrants on the other hand, have contributed $12 billion to Social Security alone as well as other federal, local and state taxes, while not being able to receive any federal, state, or local benefits.That may be a huge reason why Trump refuses to release his tax returns. Because he knows that they would expose him as the hypocrite, liar, and tax cheat that he is.Now one undocumented immigrant is bravely daring Trump to release his taxes after she proved his claims wrong with a single photograph.Belen Sisa is a resident of Arizona who was brought to America by her undocumented immigrant parents when she was six years old. Sisa decided to send a message to Donald Trump and all of those anti-immigrant conservatives who believe the myths about undocumented immigrants that right-wing groups constantly spew.So she posted a picture of herself proudly holding up her tax returns on Facebook and included the following message:I, an undocumented immigrant, just filed my taxes and PAID $300 to the state of Arizona. I cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school, I cannot benefit from unemployment, a reduced healthcare plan, or a retirement fund. I think I m a pretty good citizen. Oh and there are MILLIONS just like me who pay into a system they will never receive anything from. Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday? How about you show me yours Donald J. Trump? #HereToStay Your move, Donald.Featured Image: Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"

 CNN Guest’s Face After Trump Flack Blatantly Lies About Obama Golfing Is All Of Us Right Now (VIDEO),"It s Trump s third month in office and the lies about President Obama just keep coming.During a CNN panel to discuss Trump s 13th golf vacation, long-time Trump flack and woman without shame Kayleigh McEnany, thought she would help her president out by spinning a blatant lie about Obama. Trump should be excused from criticism for his repeated golf trips, McEnany reasoned, because Obama once golfed shortly after a journalist named Daniel Pearl was murdered by extremists in Pakistan.As anyone not currently trying to exploit his death to protect Trump might know, Pearl was murdered in 2002. Obama wouldn t become president for six years. And there is no evidence that he was golfing   as a then state senator   at the time.

For years, Trump attacked the former president for taking vacations or playing golf while he was in office. During the campaign, Trump vowed to never take a vacation and promised he would have no time for golf. Since being elected, that s gone out the window. He s now spent nearly every weekend in his first two months playing golf at courses he owns.Adding further absurdity to McEnany s defense of Trump, the president doesn t let national mourning stop his golf game. He played golf this weekend during the same time a white supremacist terrorist was charged with murdering a random black man as  practice  before a planned mass murder of black people in New York City. Trump has refused to comment on the incident. He visited his Virginia golf course twice, lying about what he was doing both times.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 28, 2017"

Trump recently proposed defunding every cent of federal funding to combat climate change. Every single cent. His new head of the EPA, a climate science denier, called fighting the devastating effects of climate change a  waste of time. Renowned climate scientist Michael Mann put what Trump is doing in the simplest possible terms: It s an all-out assault on Earth. Meanwhile, African elephants continue to slowly circle towards extinction. Plagued by a changing environment, poachers, and human development, their habitat has become a dangerous place to live.

 Sean Spicer Just Said Something About Trumpcare That Will Make Trump PISSED (DETAILS),"When Donald Trump fails, his team sure doesn t help make it any better.On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided to pour salt in the gaping wound that was left when Trump and the GOP suffered a massive failure in gaining approval for their disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare, not only failed to get enough votes, but Trump pulled it from the House floor because it was such an obvious, humiliating defeat.In speaking to reporters during his daily briefing, Spicer likened Trumpcare to a  bad deal    which was a pretty odd thing to say, considering how much Trump has bragged about what a good negotiator and dealmaker he is. To diss something that Trump supported full-heartedly is definitely not going to make Trump happy. Spicer said: The president also recognizes that when there s not a deal to be made, when to walk away. It s not just about making deals. It s knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing [that] when there s a bad deal, that s the only solution. I think the president understood that where we were, that while you can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal. And I think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had, and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand. Really, who needs critics when you have Spicer? It should also be noted that even after the bill failed, Trump was still praising the GOP s awful plan, stating that it just needed some improvement. Yet Spicer pretty much trashed Trumpcare, and said that the GOP s plan to do away with Obamacare (which they ve been bragging about for the last seven years) was a devastating fail. Looks like Trump really doesn t have a talent for making deals after all.Featured image via Ninian Reid / Flickr",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Trump’s ‘Deportation Force’ Storms Unarmed Legal Resident’s Home And Shoots Him,"A Chicago man is in critical condition after the mother of all epic f*ckups by Trump s  Deportation Force.  On Monday morning, ICE agents raided the home of Felix Torres. It is unclear why they would choose to raid the home   not a single person inside is undocumented   but apparently, we are not too concerned about accuracy when we kick down brownish people s doors in Trump s America.At approximately 6:00 a.m., immigration agents entered the home, refusing to tell any of the residents why they were there. According to officials, Torres pulled a gun on the armed men who had forced their way into his home and refused to explain their presence   Torres  family says that s utter hogwash. They didn t say anything. They just came in and pointed pistols in our faces and dragged us out,  Torres  daughter Carmen says, noting that she was not even allowed to dress or grab milk for her one-year-old daughter, who was sleeping when the armed men invaded the home.  It s a lie when they say he was holding a gun. He doesn t even own a gun,  she said.  They shot my dad. They shot him, and I don t know why. At least eight family members were in the house at the time, including numerous children. According to Carmen Torres, the family has lived there for  at least 30 years. We re going to have to talk to CPD to find out if this was a coordinated effort, because if it was in any way, that raises concerns about us as a sanctuary city,  36th Ward Alderman Gilbert Villegas said of the attack.  Is this our future in Chicago with Donald Trump as president? The community s got to be nervous about this, and rightfully so, because you have a right to be in your own home without being intimidated,  Villegas says.  I m conflicted because I haven t got all the details [of the incident] yet, but from the way this has started to play out, it looks like an overstep by an overzealous ICE agent who s just trying to follow Trump s orders. ICE officials say they were not at the home to arrest Torres, though they will nor provide further details. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is listed as critical. The shooting is being investigated, though we probably can not expect much in terms of a reasonable resolution to the situation.Featured image via Facebook",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Even Dick Cheney Is Making The Case For Why There Needs To Be A New Election,"In a more innocent time, say, 2015, you d be hard pressed to find a person willing to call Dick Cheney a voice of reason, (except perhaps, when talking about his daughter s right to marry the woman she loves), but in a speech at the Economic Times  Global Business Summit, he appeared to be just that, only in his very neo-con way. Cheney called Russia s meddling in the 2016 election an  act of war. There s no question that there was a very serious effort made by Mr. Putin and his government, his organization, to interfere in major ways with our basic fundamental democratic processes,  said Cheney.  In some quarters that could be considered an act of war. I would not underestimate the weight that we as Americans assign to Russian attempts to interfere with our process,  said Cheney, finishing the thought.Source: Business InsiderFeeling a little conflicted? Who can blame you. For nearly 20 years, Dick Cheney has been itching to go to war with nearly anyone he can find. On the other hand, he s right. There is no more blatant an act of war than interference with our election. Even Cheney is saying that Trump is likely an illegitimate president, and this is a man who only held his office as Vice President because the Supreme Court overturned the will of the people.Of course, the problem with that is that the Constitution has no mechanism for dealing with another country stealing our election. We can, however, impeach, which might not put us in a much better position. Could Donald Trump s election be nullified by some legal process, if it was found that either the Russian interference could be deemed decisive in accomplishing Trump s victory, or that Trump and his team have somehow contravened the U.S. public interest through a treasonous relationship with the Russians? Article II of the United States Constitution states in Section 4 that  The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors. Source: Midas LetterThis, apparently, is exactly where we are. While the smoking gun might still be classified, it s becoming increasingly apparent that there is a smoking gun there are several smoking guns, all covered with the fingerprints of Trump and his associates.While this might be just another case of Cheney banging the war drums, he s still right. Russian interference was an act of war and while it shouldn t be addressed with bombs and boots on the ground, it should be addressed.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Nunes ADMITS He Was Secretly At WH Right Before He Magically Found Source ‘Vindicating’ Trump,"If there is one upside to having this level of unchecked corruption running through the Trump White House it s that they aren t very good at hiding it.In yet another example of the lengths Trump s cronies will go to cover for him, the Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, was just exposed as having been secretly at the White House the night before he magically  discovered  an unnamed source that seemingly vindicated parts of Donald Trump s wiretapping claims. Nunes claims that this visit was harmless and wasn t about coordinating with Trump. And Nunes thinks you are stupid enough to believe that.Speaking to Eli Lake at Bloomberg, Nunes feigned innocence:In an interview Monday, Nunes told me that he ended up meeting his source on the White House grounds because it was the most convenient secure location with a computer connected to the system that included the reports, which are only distributed within the executive branch.  We don t have networked access to these kinds of reports in Congress,  Nunes said. He added that his source was not a White House staffer and was an intelligence official.But Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak   who recently broke the story that Nunes had disappeared the night before his  bombshell  came out   noted how ridiculous the premise was. Of course the House Intelligence Chairman has access to secure locations in the Capitol. He s the House Intelligence Committee Chairman. His whole job is working with sensitive information in a secure way.Just a reminder that the committee Nunes chairs has its own secure area, and he could have easily used that https://t.co/Z7E0cwkicl  Tim Mak (@timkmak) March 27, 2017Nunes was one of Trump s biggest supporters during the election. As head of the intelligence committee, he has repeatedly claimed that he is impartial enough to investigate Trump, but this latest exposure of malpractice might be the straw that breaks the camel s back. Nunes seems incapable of doing a single thing that doesn t point to his coordination with Donald Trump. Rather than investigate Trump, Nunes seems hellbent on providing cover for him.As if to reinforce that point, Nunes has yet to provide a shred of evidence to back up his claims that Trump was wrongfully surveilled. Ironically, the only thing he has done is bring up the possibility that Trump was incidentally recorded in FBI wiretaps of known criminals. He might want to avoid bringing that up the next time he secretly goes to the White House.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
" WATCH: After Facing Angry Constituents At Town Hall, GOP Rep Runs Out The Back Door","Just one day after Paul Ryan failed to garner support from his own base to repeal and replace Obamacare, a proposal alleged president Donald Trump staunchly supported, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) had to face hundreds of angry constituents at a town hall in Texas on Saturday. Let s just say that he didn t have a good weekend.We ll give Culberson credit for at least showing up while many of his colleagues refuse to face their own constituents. There were claims that the angry constituents were paid protesters, but, to gain entry into the auditorium attendees had to prove their residency by showing either a photo I.D. with a current address or a photo I.D. with a current utility bill.Constituents packed into a Houston middle school auditorium that was filled to a capacity of 700 with many remaining outside. About 500 people remained in a line outside, shouting,  Let us in! Let us in!Culberson had to face questions about Donald Trump and the Republicans  agenda on health care. You know what, folks? I m either going to answer the question, or we re just going to spend the time yelling,  Culberson told his crowd of constituents, according to the Houston Chronicle.The Texas congressman told his constituents that even though Republicans failed to pass Trumpcare, he was still committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare. That, too, didn t go down well. The only way to fix it is to replace it,  he said while his constituents chanted,  Fix it,  the Texas Tribune reports.When asked about the amateur president s proposal to cut the State Department, Culberson said he did not support the cuts while the crowd chanted,  Yes or no. I just answered,  he responded.  The answer is no.   I ll work hard to protect the Department of State. Culberson was pretty much booed the entire time:He also said he would support funding for the National Institutes for Health and the National Endowment for the Arts, per the Texas Tribune. He told the crowd that he would support funding for public broadcasting in the short term, but that those programs should  ultimately  be self-supporting, which was met with boos from the crowd, according to the Houston Chronicle.Here s the video:As a shock to no one ever, Culberson said it is  up to the President  whether he releases his tax returns.Then, instead of taking questions from constituents who waited for an hour and a half outside and reporters who were behind him, Culberson quickly left through the back door after the town hall. Funny thing, when you try to take away healthcare from millions of Americans, they get mad.Image via screen capture. ",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Obama’s Press Secretary Just Got A New Job; Trump’s Going To HATE It (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is soon going to be unleashing even more  fake news  attacks on the media than ever before.It turns out that former President Barack Obama s Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, just got a new job   and it s definitely going to piss the entire Trump administration off. While most Americans miss seeing Earnest s press briefings   especially because he s been replaced by pathetic Sean Spicer   we will now be able to see him speak regularly as a political contributor for NBC News and MSNBC!NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin made this announcement on Monday, and it s clear that they couldn t be happier with Earnest joining the team, considering his extensive political experience under Obama. The memo they circulated this morning said: We are pleased to announce that Josh Earnest will join NBC News and MSNBC as a Political Analyst. As you may have seen, he made his debut this morning on  Today  and  Morning Joe. Josh recently completed a ten-year run with President Obama, most recently serving as White House Press Secretary from 2014-2017.Josh joined the Obama presidential campaign in March 2007 as the Iowa communications director, and went on to serve as deputy communications director during the 2008 general election. Josh has also worked on numerous national, statewide and local campaigns over the course of his twenty years in politics. As expected, Earnest s debut was nothing but epic, and it s just what we would expect from the former Press Secretary after working closely with Obama for so many years. Earnest marked his first day in his new role in NBC s Today, where he didn t hesitate to talk about what a massive failure Trump was and how pathetic the GOP s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was.You can watch Earnest s debut here:Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Paul Ryan Was So Desperate To Pass Failed Trumpcare Bill That He Got On His Knees To Beg For Votes,"This is what being pathetic looks like.House Speaker Paul Ryan was so desperate to secure Republican votes for his disastrous healthcare bill that he literally got down on his knees to beg one lawmaker for his support.As we all know, the floor vote was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that not enough Republicans were willing to support the bill.Donald Trump even met with and threatened Republicans with consequences if they didn t fall in line. But the meeting backfired as even more Republicans leaned against the bill after hearing Trump speak.The cancellation of Thursday s vote infuriated Trump, who proceeded to demand a vote on Friday and Republican leaders reluctantly caved.And so, Paul Ryan spent time fruitlessly begging his Republican colleagues to throw their support behind a bad bill that would have stripped healthcare from over 20 million Americans and caused the cost of healthcare premiums to skyrocket.One lawmaker Ryan approached was Alaska Rep. Don Young.According to the Washington Post, Ryan actually got down on one knee to beg Young to endorse the bill.Leaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into Thursday night, with the House Rules Committee slated to meet early Friday morning to consider the proposed changes.Ryan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided.But Young ignored Ryan desperate plea and remained in opposition and even praised the cancellation of Friday s vote a  victory for Alaska. My job is to represent those people in that state, and I think we did this this week,  Young told Alaska Dispatch News.  I work with (House Speaker Paul Ryan), don t get me wrong   the speaker talked to me quite a bit. But it didn t come to a point where I could support this bill. He needed my vote. Yeah, he needed it so much that he begged for it on bended knee. Sad!Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Dan Rather: Trump’s First Two Months In Office Is Worst Start He’s Ever Seen,"Legendary newsman Dan Rather has lived through and covered several presidencies so he knows what he s talking about.Rather was just a boy of 13 when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945. In 1950, he began his career in journalism while Harry Truman was in office.Since then, Rather has witnessed every presidential beginning and has even reported on them.And according to Rather, Donald Trump s first two months in the presidency are the worst he has ever seen.Rather posted his observation on Facebook early Monday morning, even going so far as to quip that the only president who had a worse start was William Henry Harrison, who died one month after being sworn in.We re roughly two months into the Trump Presidency, and it is the worst start to a time in office I have ever seen. I am not alone in this conclusion. Many Presidential scholars are saying it s the worst start of any Presidency in the history of the country.Now William Henry Harrison in 1841 talked too long in the cold of his inauguration. He caught pneumonia and died a month later. So, yes, I suppose you could say that his time was worse.One of those Presidential scholars is Douglas Brinkley, who said that that Trump s administration is so bad that treason is hanging over it. This is the most failed first 100 days of any president,  Brinkley concluded.Rather then briefly listed some of Trump s failures.So after two tumultuous, chaotic and in many ways outrageous months (an embarrassing defeat on ACA repeal, the deepening Russia probe, the striking down of the travel ban) where do we stand? Where does all of this go?Rather went on to warn the American people that  a weak President running a weak, ragtag administration is a prescription for trouble. Trouble internationally could come from enemies and other competitors who may see opportunities for advantage and overreach. Trouble internally could easily come from a worried, divided nation, and opportunistic ideologues and politicians who try to exploit the situation.Rather concluded by urging people to remain vigilant and continue fighting.Donald Trump and his entire administration is a bad joke. He has turned our nation into a laughingstock around the world and has repeatedly demonstrated that he is incompetent.Trump should resign before he embarrasses our country and himself even further.Featured Image: Matthew Eisman/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 BREAKING: Devin Nunes Is Now The Subject Of A CRIMINAL Complaint To The FBI,"Embattled House Intel Chairman, Devin Nunes (R-CA), has been reported to the FBI for corruption. The criminal complaint, filed by Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, seems to include Nunes  failure to disclose the fact that he s got all his money sunk into a winery with heavy ties to Russia (which means he s got a conflict of interest). It may also includ his admission that he had an obligation to inform Trump that some of his transition team s communications got swept up in a foreign surveillance operation.Nunes is definitely compromised, which is worth investigating.Dworkin can t make the details of his complaint public, but he did say that Nunes is unethical and that he was working on just such a complaint earlier today:RT if u think Devin Nunes is unethicalI doI m finishing our House Ethics Complaint on him now#NunesMustResign #trumprussia #russiagate  Scott Dworkin (@funder) March 26, 2017Then he tweeted the news that his criminal complaint had officially been filed, along with the FBI s explanation of their public corruption program.

 California Governor Delivers HARSH Message To Donald Trump; He’s Messing With The Wrong State (VIDEO),"It s no secret that Californians aren t really fans of Donald Trump and Trump can t stand California. California rejected Trump during the election by a whopping 30 percent margin. In turn, Trump has called the most populous state in the union,  out of control,  and threatened to withhold money if they don t bend to Trump s will. California s governor, Jerry Brown, on Meet the Press on Sunday, said Trump would be picking a fight with the wrong governor.At specific issue is that fact that many of California s cities are sanctuary cities, which means it s safe for undocumented residents to report crimes without fear of deportation. Now, anyone with half a brain knows that people reporting crimes is one of the biggest weapons against criminals, but Trump tells his supporters that sanctuary cities are hotbeds of danger. They aren t. In fact because people can report crime, they are typically safer.California is not backing down to Trump s bullying. If he pulls funding from California, California is going to retaliate and that s the last thing Trump wants. We do have something called the ninth and the tenth amendment,  he stated.  The federal government just can t arbitrarily for political reasons punish the State of California, that s number one. Number two, California is America. We re 12 percent. We re a key part. The export capital going into the Pacific. We re the innovation capital, high tech, agriculture, 40 to 50 billion dollar industry. You don t want to mess with California because you re going to mess with the economy, and that could blow up in your face in a gigantic recession, and roll the Republicans right out of this town. Source: NBC NewsHere s the video: Brown isn t just talking out his you-know-what. Without California, the country is in a whole lot of hurt. Not only is it the largest state, it s also the 6th largest economy in the world. Its economy surpasses France and India. Or, if Trump voters need to see something a bit more tangible, let s just say that without California, the cost of food (if you can find it) will go through the roof.California produces a sizable majority of many American fruits, vegetables, and nuts: 99 percent of artichokes, 99 percent of walnuts, 97 percent of kiwis, 97 percent of plums, 95 percent of celery, 95 percent of garlic, 89 percent of cauliflower, 71 percent of spinach, and 69 percent of carrots (and the list goes on and on).Without California, supply of all these products in the United States and abroad would dip, and in the first few years, a few might be nearly impossible to find. Orchard-based products in particular, such as nuts and some fruits, would take many years to spring back.Price surges would eventually become the larger issue. Rising prices would force Americans to consume more grains, which are locked in a complicated price-dependent relationship with fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. When the price of produce increases, people eat more grain. When the price of grain drops, people eat more fruits and vegetables. (In fact, in some parts of the world, wheat and rice are the only proven  Giffen goods a product in which decreasing prices lead to decreasing demand.) Young people and the poor in America, more than others, eat less fresh food when prices rise.Source: SlateBeyond that, though, could you imagine, if just once, President Obama threatened to pull funding from, let s say, Texas   a state which was consistently hostile to the Democratic President. Republicans and many Democrats would have had a fit and they would have been right. Donald Trump works for us, all of us, not just the people who voted for him. It s time he learn that and Jerry Brown is the perfect person to teach the lesson.Featured image via video screen capture. ",News,"March 26, 2017"

And now we have Newt Gingrich s old tweet coming back to haunt him.The disgraced former House Speaker tweeted in 2013,  Trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn t charge the taxpayers $920,000 for a golf weekend in florida. Trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn't charge the taxpayers $920,000 for a golf weekend in florida.  Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 8, 2013We can only assume Gingrich meant Obama, not  obsma. Well, he did inadvertently get that right. Each time Trump goes to his Mar-a-Lago resort, it costs taxpayers $3 million, not $920,000. The alleged president is on track to spend $1 billion in 4 years to house his wife in New York City and vacationing in Mar-a-Lago virtually every week.The Internet pounced on Gingrich s hypocritical tweet.@newtgingrich hey newt, it's so cool how you're not even embarrassed to shart in public.

The former House Speaker has been strangely quiet over Donald Trump s repeated trips to the golf course, and what s really disturbing is that he regularly goes golfing at Trump-owned golf clubs, meaning that there is another conflict of interest for us to deal with. Trump is literally profiting from his  presidency. In 2011, the former reality show star tweeted,  I play golf to relax. My company is in great shape. @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain. Meanwhile, Trump broke another campaign promise, this one to repeal and replace Obamacare. Instead, he offered tax breaks for the wealthy while throwing the elderly, veterans and lower-income Americans under the bus. Then he went golfing after his plan failed miserably.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images with added tweet. ",News,"March 26, 2017"
" Trump Insulted German Leader On First Visit, Gave Her A ‘Bill’ For NATO (DETAILS)","The fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no fan of Donald Trump is no secret. However, being the diplomatic, experienced world leader that she is, Chancellor Merkel took the time she was forced to spend at the White House with Trump in stride. She smiled at the cameras at all the right times, held a joint presser with him, and was cordial to all, as real world leaders do. This all comes as Trump insulted Merkel more than once during the visit. We all know that he infamously embarrassed our nation by petulantly refusing to shake the Chancellor s hand, and now, there is a new report out that Trump actually gave Merkel an  invoice  for expenses that he believes Germany owes for defenses provided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).According to The Hill via a report from The Times of London, Trump s insane bill  charges  Merkel roughly 300 billion pounds. A response from a German minister on Trump s childish stunt was predictably and deservedly scathing, essentially saying that Merkel has no intentions of stooping to Trump s level: The concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side, but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations. The same minister said that Merkel, quote,  ignored the provocations.  Of course, the White House says that Trump never gave Merkel the invoice, but that s likely just another lie to cover up for Trump s petulant, childish, and internationally embarrassing behavior.In fact, it is perfectly plausible that Trump gave Merkel this  invoice,  because he had already had aides calculate just how much below 2 percent of Germany s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was spent on NATO defense in the last 12 years. Countries within NATO all commit to spending 2 percent of their GDP annually to support NATO. Trump even had the people doing the calculations add interest.This is just beyond embarrassing. Here is another ally we are on the rocks with, all because we have a president who acts like a whiny school yard bully instead of leader of the free world.Featured image Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images",News,"March 26, 2017"
 Hannity Just Fired Off An ABSURD Tweet At CBS For Koppel Interview – Twitter SHREDS Him For It,"Sean Hannity is pissed. Really pissed. Earlier today, he appeared on CBS   Sunday Morning  for an interview with veteran ABC News anchor Ted Koppel, which didn t go well for him. In that interview, Hannity did his level best to keep Koppel from making his point (meaning he was interrupting Koppel every chance he got), but Koppel wasn t having it. He literally said that he thinks Hannity and his ilk are  bad for America,  and dropped the hammer on why: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than fact. That s the truth, and Hannity doesn t like it. In a way, he s like Trump   he s not wrong, everyone else is wrong. Whether or not he agrees with something is what determines whether it is a fact. So, like his idol, President Cheeto McTinyhands, he took to Twitter to blast CBS for editing the interview the way they did: Fake Edited News  @CBSNews release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room. I dare you! https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 Fake Edited News,  and then a demand that they air the entire 45-minute interview is classic Donald Trump. But what can we expect? It s been obvious for a long time that he s in love with Trump. Now he s even copying him, so when can we expect Hannity to start stalking him?More to the point, though, as someone who himself conducts on-air interviews that have time constraints on them, Hannity is acting extremely hypocritically here. He also just made himself look incredibly dumb   both things with which Twitter is having a field day:@seanhannity Has your show ever edited an interview or cut one short due to time constraints?Or are you just a massive hypocrite? @CBSNews  Steven Buckley (@StevenJCBuckley) March 26, 2017@seanhannity @CBSNews look at you using daddy s  quote  marks.

So so so much winning ??  Loveandlight (@o  thank  the hotel magnate was America Ferrera herself. In a piece written for Huffington Post last summer, Ferrera wrote: You, Mr. Trump, are living in an outdated fantasy of a bigoted America. Last week, America celebrated some amazing milestones   marriage equality, universal healthcare, removing of the confederate flag   making it clear in which direction the country is moving. That is why racist remarks that play to extremists won t change the tide, no matter how hard you try. They will only serve to rally more Latino voters to the polls. Your negativity and your poorly thought out speech ignited a fire in our community. Thank you, Mr. Trump!Thank you for reminding us that there remains an antiquated and endangered species of bigots in this country that we must continue to combat. Thank you for reminding us to not sit complacently at home on election day, but to run to the polls and proclaim that there is no place for your brand of racial politicking in our government. Thank you for sending out the rallying cry.You have made your thoughts on the Latino community clear and you continue to stand by them. And in return, we will do more than tweet about our indignation and beat pi atas of your likeness. We will silence you at the polls. We will vote and use our growing position in U.S. politics. Our fellow Americans who understand and value our contributions will join us. We know there is nothing that scares you more.The truth is, Mr. Trump, that your comments mean that you fail to see that immigrants are what have made this nation. They are at the core of our ideals, and they are the foundation that keeps us afloat. No, Mr. Trump, you may not reduce us to drug dealers and rapists. We are moms and dads, sons and daughters. We are valedictorians and honor students. We are college graduates, bankers, police officers, entertainers, teachers, journalists, politicians and we are the future of America.Thank you for helping us in our work to energize the Latino vote and to usher in our shared future! Keep it up! So, while Trump s racism ignites the fire under a dying breed of racism in this nation of people who would clearly still like to own people as property, the rest of the United States in living in 2016, embracing equality of all races, genders and sexual orientations, and will absolutely wallop Trump at the polls if he happens to win the nomination.All in all, Trump deserves condemnation, he deserves to be made fun of, and most of all   he deserves to lose.Video/Featured image: Hollywood Reporter",News,"January 11, 2016"
 Watch How White Supremacists Are Working To Win The Iowa Caucus For Trump (VIDEO),"If the current national Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump wins the Iowa caucuses, he may have to send a thank you card to a group of white supremacists.A super PAC set up by white nationalists (thanks to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court for that, by the way) is now doing robocalls on behalf of the Trump campaign to Iowa voters.https://www.facebook.com/david.dwyer.501/videos/10205589938852221/ I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America,  Jared Taylor said on the robocall, paid for by the American National Super PAC.  We don t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump. Taylor is the founder of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance. The robocall included two more endorsements from a conservative Christian talk show host and the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party.Since he launched his presidential campaign by blaming Mexicans for rape and murder and encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters for the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has attracted growing support from the white nationalist movement. They view his candidacy with its explicit appeal to white power enthusiasts as the first such outwardly racially bigoted campaign within the two major parties in U.S. history.Trump has also, of course, signaled that a presidency underneath his control would operate in a fascistic manner, banning travel to the United States by Muslims and also creating a national database of Muslims similar to the types of records created by Hitler s Nazi regime in Germany.Despite the outward support for Trump with figures like former Klansman David Duke and those otherwise aligned with the movement in favor of white supremacy, the mainstream media has largely shied away from labeling Trump supporters as bigots. Instead multiple mainstream articles and news reports insist that Trump s base of support comes from those concerned about  economic inequality.  Of course, Senator Bernie Sanders has made the fight to rectify that inequality as the centerpiece of his campaign, explicitly rejecting the racial and religious hatred embraced by Trump and so far not condemned by the party itself.Featured image via flickr",News,"January 11, 2016"
 Conservatives Will Hate Why Obama Invited This Woman To The State Of The Union,"President Obama is using his final State of the Union address to spike the ball on some of the accomplishments he has been able to achieve in the two terms of his presidency. As evidence of those achievements, several guests have been invited to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama.Among those guests will be U.S. Army Major Lisa Jaster, and her sterling accomplishment was becoming one of the first three women in the history of the United States to qualify as a U.S. Army Ranger.Before Obama was President, women were not permitted to try out for this elite designation. Now they are.Jaster was one of 19 women who attempted the Army Ranger course in April, when it was opened to female service members for the first time. In some ways, she was the most unusual of them: While most troops who attend are on active duty, male and in their 20s, she was a 37-year-old officer who was activated from the Army Reserve to go, temporarily leaving behind a successful career as an engineer with Shell Oil in Houston and her husband and two young children for a shot at making history.Jaster said in a phone interview Friday that she wants to show that there are men and women capable of succeeding in almost any role. I want my presence to symbolize the fact that there are competent people out there, and as long as the standards don t change, the best person for each job needs to be placed in that job,  she said.Amazingly, in this day and age there are conservative Republicans who still oppose the idea of women serving in combat positions in the military, despite most Americans realizing that if they can pull their own weight there should be no obstacle to service simply due to gender.Major Jaster shows that it can be done, and that America has finally reached a place where we have the best defending us no matter what sex they are. That s part of the Obama legacy.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 11, 2016"
 Breitbart Racist Is Attacking Neil Degrasse Tyson: ‘He Is Stupid And His Politics Are Dumb’,"Let s face it, Republicans hate Neil Degrasse Tyson because he is the Obama of science. If the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters, they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  ASTROPHYSICISTS.A great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the Republican outrage mill Breitbart. In it, the author implies that liberals are racist because they love Tyson. This is followed up immediately by Breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on TV.Tyson, whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on TV, hasn t published anything of note for years. The advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science.He didn t get the PhD he was studying for at the University of Texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification. Obviously, rather than take responsibility for his academic performance, Tyson has blamed racism. In reality, Tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays. Typical science PhD students are at any given time either studying, teaching or sleeping.In 2005, he said: I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity. He of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason Neil deGrasse Tyson is on television at all, given his intellectual shortcomings, is that he is black.Source: BreitbartHere is another famously liberal scientist, who Republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings,  that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt.image: RedStateQuick fact check. Tyson did not blame his lack of a Ph.D. from UT on racism. He was talking about racism on campus, like when he was stopped 7 times by campus police for walking near the physics building. It s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium. His Ph.D. pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee.It took 16 seconds of Google to find that information.Apparently Breitbart is an authority in Astronomy, Physics, and Astrophysics, because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough.  in the fields. They also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying Tyson hasn t published anything of note in years. Tyson has published 13 papers, which is more than Breitbart has done, and last time I checked Breitbart did not do peer-review of any published scientific material.They also hate Tyson because he thinks about something other than Jesus.On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 25, 2014Tyson hasn t published as much work as some others, but there is a context to that. He made a choice to serve the public over himself. Instead of being insulated within the scientific community, he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people. He went out and made science cool again when Republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared.It s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way. A black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative America. There HAS to be a conspiracy by liberal whites to foist his blackness upon America s heartland.featured image via youtube",News,"January 10, 2016"
 This Terrified Six-Year Old’s 911 Call Is Heartbreaking (VIDEO),"After her step-father began beating her mother, a terrified six-year-old child rushed to the phone to call for help.Through her hysterical sobs, she told the emergency dispatch worker that her  mommy and daddy are having a fight. As the worker tries to get more information, Lisa pleads with her to please send the police.  This has been going on forever and ever,  she sobs. A few moments later the little girl can be heard hysterically screaming at her step-father,  STOP IT! We can t see what s happening, but we can hear the anguish and terror in her voice as she begs the 911 operator to send help. He hurt mommy Can you just send the police please,  she cries.After the operator instructs her to go and unlock the door so the police can get into the house, the little girl returns to the phone.At this points we hear her scream  He just knocked my sister out,  then saying  My little sister. The-four-year-old. There s another scream,  OH MY GOD. He s got the baby. Listen to the heartbreaking call below, via FacesofChildAbuse on YouTube.  The recording, now known as the Lisa Tape, is used by agencies across the country to educate people on the impact that domestic violence on children.After listening to the call, I had to find out what happened to that little girl and her family.I found out that Lisa, her mom and her siblings made it out of the situation alive.Today, Lisa Floyd is an advocate for survivors of domestic violence.Sadly, many domestic violence stories do not have the same kind of happy ending this one does.Every nine seconds another woman living in the United States will be the target of violence from a husband, boyfriend or intimate partner. These attacks result in more than 2 million injuries to women and 1,300 deaths, annually.We know that every year at least 3.3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes.Like Lisa s younger siblings, children who live in homes where domestic violence occurs are as 1,500 times more likely to become the targets of abuse.According to the National Domestic Violence Center, 50 percent of men who engage in violence toward an intimate partner, also abuse their children.Yet sentences for perpetrators of domestic violence remain shamelessly lenient in the United States. For example, the minimum sentence for someone convicted of domestic violence in the state of California is probation. In Florida, it is five days in the county jail. In Louisiana it s four days, at least 48 hours of which must served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.Even more shocking, the average prison sentence for a man who kills a spouse or intimate partner in the United States is two to six years.Is it any wonder that at least 60 percent of domestic violence perpetrators repeat the violent behavior?When you listen to Lisa s tape and hear the terror in her voice, or when you look at the shocking statistics that show us how many women and children suffer horrible acts of violence at the hands men like Lisa s step-father, and then you compare those things to the consequences that our society considers  reasonable,  it s nothing less than shameful.Domestic violence remains the leading cause of injury to women in the United States. It s also the number cause of homelessness for women in children in the United States.Those statistics aren t going to change until we stop letting the perpetrators off the hook with a slap on the wrist.*image credit: wikimedia commons ",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Experts Think Gas Prices About To Go Lower Than EVER – You Won’t Believe How Low (IMAGES),"For some time now, the United States has been experiencing a rapid decline in gas prices. It s almost hard to forget when the last time filling up at the tank was a burdensome thing   that s because nearly two years has gone by since gas was over $3.00 a gallon (on average across the United States). Over the last year or so, gas prices have dropped even further, due to Saudia Arabia continuing to keep up output, and the Iran deal that is expected to glut the global market even more so. All of this is great news   but it looks like the good news will keep on flowing (pun intended) according to experts in the industry.The AAA and GasBuddy, two top organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that if refinery capacity stays strong the price of a gallon of gasoline could reach historic lows of $1.00 a gallon in some areas   a level that hasn t been reached since 1999. That would be quite a remarkable event.Prices are already low by historical standards and depending on which part of the country you live in, already under $2.00 a gallon. If you look at the map below, you will easily be able to see which parts of the United States already receive the cheapest gas. There are very few areas colored in dark green (lower than $1.38 a  gallon). Most of the middle part of the country is either light green ($1.68-$1.83), or yellow ($1.83-$1.98). If gas is pushed downward to $1.00 a gallon, that s still a huge percentage drop no matter where you live.Pic via Gas BuddyGas prices are mostly driven by four things: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies.We already know that crude oil prices are going to continue to fall. Although, there are a few detractors, there always are. Nevermind that   here s what the money managers that run the economy are doing: while 6,346 of them bet on higher prices (okay   fair enough) 17,517 of them bet on lower prices. It s not even close. This is the least bullish investors have been on oil in more than five years, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.All in all, gasoline futures fell 1.83 cents or 1.6%, to $1.12 a gallon   the lowest it s been since February 2009. And   gasoline also fell 14.33 cents a gallon (11% for the week) which also happens to be the largest weekly loss since September 2009.If the experts are right, $1.00 a gallon gasoline may not be that far off.

" Former Obama Adviser BLASTS Trump, Calls Him Out For Attracting All The Racist Idiots (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has helped America s racists feel good about showing their true colors in all their bigoted glory. Furthermore, amazingly, the more racist Trump s remarks get, the higher he goes in the polls. Things that would be political suicide for almost anyone else seem to work wonders for Trump s numbers. Well, there is yet another person who is calling Trump out: Former adviser to President Obama, Van Jones.What has Jones so upset is most ominous indeed. It seems that a  think tank  of white power types that go by the name American Renaissance is so impressed with Trump s racism that they are now making robocalls on behalf of his bid for the presidency. The calls focus specifically on Trump s  ban all Muslims  plan. The horrible message says: We don t need Muslims. We need smart well-educated white people who can assimilate to our culture. Van Jones appeared on Face the Nation on Sunday, and he blasted the dangerous, bigoted rhetoric that has made Trump so popular with racists: This is troubling. If I were [Donald] Trump, this is a time to look in the mirror. Who am I inspiring? Who am I attracting? Why will horrible racist groups say I m the only candidate that speaks for them? This is what is   my deep concern is that Donald Trump is beginning to legitimate some of the dark things that have been in our country for a long time, and now starting to let them elevate, let them rise. Jones is right, of course, but, unfortunately, Trump doesn t care. All he cares about is numbers, and if it takes being bald-faced racist to get them, then, by God, that s what he ll do. The GOP s base is full of ignorant bigots, and Donald Trump has done a perfect job of courting them.

 WATCH: Paul Ryan Gets Slapped In The Face With A Huge Dose Of Reality About Obamacare (VIDEO),"Last week, Republicans in Congress decided to once again waste everyone s time and tax dollars trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They know that there isn t a snowball s chance in hell that President Obama was going to approve any of their attempts to repeal the law. However, they continued the ritual of passing doomed legislation anyway, only to have it vetoed by President Obama on Friday.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan discussed the Republicans  atest attempt to repeal the ACA on Sunday during an interview on Face the Nation. During the interview, the show s host John Dickerson grilled Ryan on the Party s lack of a viable option to the ACA. You said that you wanted the Republicans to offer an alternative to the president. One of the first things you did this year, though, was offer that repeal,  Dickerson reminded Ryan.  How is than an alternative?  Dickerson asked. It s not,  Ryan responded.  It s why we have to come up with an alternative. So, you re right about that one. Will you?  Dickerson asked, skeptically. Absolutely,  Ryan stated, earnestly.  My goal   I don t know how far it will go given we have a filibuster and a guy named Obama who s not going to replace Obamacare   but my goal is that, we as Republicans, if we don t like these laws, don t like the direction the country is going, I think we have to be more than just an opposition party. It should be noted that during the rest of the 10-minute interview, Ryan names a plethora of problems in the United States, yet doesn t offer anything resembling any actual solutions to those problems. We have to be a proposition party,  went on to say.  So, if we don t like this, we ve got to show how we would do things differently. And we really think Obamacare is failing, whether it s premiums, restricted access, high deductibles, families losing the insurance they wanted to keep. People are hurting and we need to offer a solution. So, yes, on this and many other issues, we need to offer alternatives. And that s exactly what I intend on having us do. Which is exactly what every Republican has said since the ACA became law. They have absolutely nothing to offer the American people to replace the ACA with. The only viable place for healthcare to move forward in the United States at this point, is to create a single payer system. And of course, the Republican Party isn t going to propose that any time too soon.You can watch the full interview below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Economist Responsible For ‘Reaganomics’ Makes Laughable 2016 Election Prediction,"Arthur Laffer, known for inspiring Republican economic ideology since the Reagan-era, and largely considered to be the father of supply-side economics, has just come out with another prediction. No, not another false trickle-down theory of  if you cut taxes on the rich  governmental revenues will somehow maximize, and we ll all be better off   this time he is weighing in on the outcome of the 2016 election.Not only does he think Republicans will win in a  landslide,  he thinks they re going to win practically every state. Here s what he told host John Catsimatidis on New York s AM-970 on Sunday: I would be surprised if the Republicans don t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50. I mean, I think we re going to landslide this election. That s some estimation on his part. The last time that happened was when Walter Mondale was running for president against Ronald Reagan. That was three decades ago   this guy must still be living in the 1980s. Since then most economists have come out on the record stating his economic theories have been wrong, and that  trickle-down  economics is straight up bogus. His  Laffer-curve  even has it s own laughable tag line: Laughing at the Laffer- Curve. Governmental revenues have declined since it was first implemented, giving tax cuts to the rich that ultimately hurt the economy AND the federal government s source of income. Still, that hasn t kept him from being a big wig within top Republican circles. Hey   rich guys like their tax cuts, we get it. Now they ll do anything and everything to keep on justifying those lower tax rates they have become accustomed to.Here s what else he had to say in the interview: When I look at these candidates, I don t see one of them who wouldn t do a great job as president. I think Donald Trump is phenomenal, I think Rand Paul has done a great job, I even like Jeb Bush   I think Jeb Bush is great, he did a wonderful job in Florida. Chris Christie   phenomenal. He also took a few jabs at Hillary Clinton, but pretended to be nice about it, saying that her  day is over. We get that he s a fan of Republicans, but there is no hard data to suggest even what he is predicting. It would be interesting if he could cite some source or reference for why he thinks Republicans are going to win practically every state, or why he would be  surprised  if they didn t. Yet   he doesn t provide any of that.If his 2016 election prediction is anything like his economic policies, you can rest assured it s flat-out wrong.Featured image via Laffer Center.",News,"January 10, 2016"

" Bernie Sanders Blocked From Speaking At Iowa High School, Guess Who They Let Speak Instead","Urbandale High School students worked hard to get a presidential candidate come to speak at their school in Urbandale, Iowa. Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump said that they would come speak to at the high school. Trump ended up speaking during the school s homecoming. Sanders was blocked by the administration.The Des Moines Register reports on the story, saying: The billionaire Republican visited the high school s homecoming in September after students launched a month-long campaign to recruit a presidential candidate to campus. Students had also reached out to the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who couldn t make the fall homecoming dance, but expressed interest in a later visit. Campaign officials recently tried to firm up Sanders  visit, but were turned down by school administrators. Students say they were told that another candidate visit would be too much of an administrative hassle. There were allegations of the school playing favoritism by only letting a Republican candidate speak to the school. The move prompted a backlash from some of the students. We let Donald Trump come as a presidential candidate, but in reality the main focus of his appearance at our school was that he was a high-profile celebrity,  said Josh Ingham, a senior at the school.  So we wanted a politician that is only involved in politics. So when the administration turned down this opportunity, we were kind of surprised and outraged since the campaign directly contacted our school. We had the opportunity. Ultimately, the matter was resolved with a somewhat weak compromise. Sanders wasn t allowed to speak at the school but some Urbandale students were given reserved seats at a Sanders  event. They were able to meet Sanders back stage at the event.The Des Moines Register reports that Ingham who, along with other students, was about to launch a petition to get the school s administration to reverse their decision, got a very special shout out from Sanders at the event: Sanders  Iowa staffers reserved prime seats at his Saturday evening appearance at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and set up a quick meet-and-greet with the candidate. About 25 Urbandale students gathered backstage behind a black curtain that separated them from the crowd of more than 1,500 waiting for the Vermont senator s arrival.When Sanders reached the venue, he handed a microphone over to Ingham and asked him to tell the group what had happened at the school. He told them standing up to their school was  a very brave thing to do. It s great that those students who attended the event got to have that experience. However, it is antithetical to the idea of civics education to have only one candidate, from one party speak. Representative democracy is about having candidates present their ideas, and then letting people decide who they agree with. When an institution only lets one side of the aisle speak, all they are doing is providing another bully pulpit for that party or candidate. Which is totally not cool.At least some of those students learned a valuable lesson. When the establishment screws you over   organize.Featured Image Credit:By Michael Vadon (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Charles Koch Has The Sads Because He Thinks He Should Have More Influence Over Elections,"Charles Koch, the billionaire CEO of Koch Industries has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political campaigns because of Citizen s United, but he still thinks he should have even more influence.During an interview with the Financial Times, Charles Koch whined that even as he spends tons of money trying to shape the political landscape to his will he still doesn t have as much influence as he expected to have in 2016.Koch says he presented of list of his wishes to Republican candidates, who basically ignored them, which is why he is pouting now. (It) doesn t seem to faze them much,  Koch said.  You d think we could have more influence. It is hard for me to get a high level of enthusiasm because the things I m passionate about and I think this country urgently needs aren t being addressed. In other words, Koch has the sads because he hoped Republicans would automatically be his puppets and support and enact all of his demands.The billionaire polluter actually gave the candidates a freaking LIST of things he wants them to do if they win the presidency and now he thinks he needs even more influence because the candidates didn t seem to give two shits about it.According to Politico, the Koch brothers are poised to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 election, in what should be seen as a blatant effort to buy the White House and Congress.Among the many aims on their agenda is the destruction of labor unions, abolishing the minimum wage, dismantling environmental protection laws, and repealing Obamacare while opposing any effort to bring affordable healthcare to the American people. And those are just a few things that the Koch brothers want to do to this country.Charles Koch attempted a run for president in the 1980s, but he failed miserably. Instead, he decided to focus on buying the government instead.But despite his massive influence on Republican politics, Koch is complaining that he still doesn t have enough power over the candidates. In reality, the American people are the ones who should be complaining about not having enough influence over elections, which the Kochs believe they are entitled to buy.If the Koch brothers are wondering why most of the American people see them as villains, this is why.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Michigan’s Republican Governor Needs Your Tax Dollars To Fix The Flint Water Crisis He Created,"The water crisis in Flint is not just simply a man-made disaster, it is the actualization of unconstrained Republican policy. For more than a year, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and the emergency manager of Flint ignored the voices of all those who spoke out about the contamination of Flint s water. Now, Michigan is forced to rely on Obama and the federal government to rescue them.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.For those not in the know, an emergency manager acts as the feudal lord for cities that want to behave fiscally irresponsibly. The emergency manager law was implemented by Snyder. When a local government fails to meet certain criteria, the governor appoints an emergency manager to replace the city government. The local government still exists, but those democratically elected officials do not have any real power. You might say that s just tough luck for Michiganders who elected Snyder. But you would be wrong. The emergency manager law was overturned through a ballot initiative in 2012. Snyder and Michigan s Republican-controlled state government decided to replace the law, with an almost exact copy.Now as many as 100,000 people have been poisoned by reckless neglect (and Republicans  unfaltering devotion to destroying effective government.) This disaster was entirely preventable. The same way that the massive water shut offs in Detroit, that have received international condemnation, are completely unnecessary.At this point, there is no way that the Flint water crisis can be solved without receiving financial aid from the federal government. Snyder declared the disaster a state wide emergency last week, which makes it so that he can request financial aid from the federal government. Snyder must call on the Obama administration to fix his mess.Featured Image Credit: Michigan Municipal League via Flickr Creative Commons License 2.0",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Bundy ‘Militia’ Is Begging You To Send Them A Bunch Of Tampons — For Freedom,"Folks, Barack Obama s tyranny has hit the fine, upstanding patriots currently occupying a federal building in Oregon hard. Not only did the crazed, armed occupiers  mommies forget to pack snacks for them, but they seem to have run out of clean underwear and tampons   as well as other items needed for their pretend revolution (don t worry, they do have plenty of guns).Even though police have promised them the freedom to move in and out of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge   a strange thing to grant terrorists   these grown men playing cowboy seem entirely incapable of driving to the store to buy their own supplies. The new wish list, posted to Twitter by extremism analyst J.J. McNab, includes much more than snacks.The militants now want supporters to provide them with tampons, underwear, t-shirts, money, blankets, socks, bed sheets, shampoo, deodorant (let s face it   that many Teabillies in one place can get a bit smelly), gaming supplies, and cigarettes:The need for tampons is no laughing matter. Recently, one of the militants announced that they plan to use women and children as shields against anything they view as an attack   in that case, the presence of women and children was used to dissuade the evil government from shutting off the electricity. This, of course, is a tactic that was used at Bundy Ranch as well, with one armed terrorist revealing that  If they are going to start shooting, it s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot. I personally think that helping them would be a great idea. Send as many tampons as you want (using that big, bad government mail system) to:Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, c/o Y All Qaeda36391 Sodhouse LnPrinceton, OR 9772Let s send them more tampons than they will ever use. They can find their own damn coats.If you don t want to waste money on tampons, make a phone call and urge the FBI to finally take action against these dangerous domestic terrorists.Featured image via FreakOutNation",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Donald Trump Likes How North Korean Dictator Kills People To Solidify Power (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents. You ve got to give him credit,  Trump gushed. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that. A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power. Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign. After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies. He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt. He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt. If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Gabby Giffords Has Made Her Choice For Who She Wants As The Next President,"The adversity that former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) has had to overcome is nothing short of breathtaking. After being shot in the head during a meet and greet with her constituents five years ago, she has made a comeback that could put her at hero status. She s a hero, because not only has she made a startling recovery, but she has dedicated her life to trying to making sure no one has to endure the pain of gun violence. Through her organization Americans for Responsible Solutions, alongside her husband retired astronaut Mark Kelly, they have made it their life s work.Now, knowing that the epidemic of gun violence is still rampant, Giffords knows we will need a continued strong voice of leadership in the White House to combat the gun lobby and fight to enact gun legislation that will be proactive and lasting. Later this week, Giffords is expected to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Clinton has released through her campaign comprehensive solutions to reduce gun violence. She knows we are well past the time to enact proper legislation.This endorsement may come as a surprise to some, but to others it will make perfect sense. Clinton has long been a supporter of better gun reform while her democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady bill five times, and according to CBS news: Sanders voted in favor of 2005 law that absolved gun manufacturers of any legal liability when someone uses their products during the commission of a crime. Part of Clinton s goals for gun reform includes a repeal to the gun industry s immunity protection: Hillary believes the gun industry must be held accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Hillary will lead the charge to repeal the so-called  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,  a dangerous law that prevents victims of gun violence from holding negligent manufacturers and dealers accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Giffords, alongside her husband, want gun reform, and she seems to be endorsing the candidate who has a history of standing strong against the gun lobby and is most likely to continue President Obama s efforts, combat Republicans and their perversion of the Second Amendment, and get the job done.Featured image: Americans For Responsible Solutions",News,"January 10, 2016"
" In HISTORY MAKING Kiss Cam Moment, Gay Couple Featured At NHL Game (VIDEO)","During nearly every sporting event, at one point in the game, the cameras are taken off the game to scan the crowd for loving couples to smooch each other on the infamous  Kiss Cam.  Almost always, or let s just say it like it is, these cameras seem to always find straight couples. However, last year, a beautiful couple got caught on the Kiss Cam at Dodger stadium, and it looks as though another beautiful couple got their moment recently during a hockey game.In what is being reported as the first same-sex Kiss Cam moment in NHL history, Brad Parr and Andy Evans, while attending a Los Angeles Kings game at the Staples Center, were featured. The kiss drew huge cheers from the crowd.Parr told Outsports: It was a particularly sweet night since the Kings were playing and beat my hometown Toronto. My parents and siblings live in LA but the rest of my family think I am a terrible traitor for being a Kings fan; I ve lived in LA for 17 years. Not only did these fantastic men get to smooch in front of thousands of fellow King s fans, but they are also triathletes raising money for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society s Team in Training.This beautiful moment in history is wonderful and shows the progress we ve made as a nation, but it also highlights that in 2016, we re just now getting around to acknowledging that gay couples, male and female, do in fact attend sporting events.Congrats to the beautiful couple, and if you d like to donate to help their cause, go HERE.You can see the full video HERE, but here s a highlight of just the pair in their moment in history: Progress!

 New Group Of Armed Idiots Show Up To Provide ‘Security’ For Bundy Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does. The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the  security  for the militia. There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to  protect  the original occupying militia. However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that. We don t want it and we re asking you to leave. According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has. MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote,  alarmed  by the Pacific Patriot Network guards. According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be  patrolling the perimeter  and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there. The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them. At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people. It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 10, 2016"
 This Homeless Veteran Receives A Gift From A Child He’ll Never Forget (VIDEO),"Most of us don t know what it s like to be homeless, but three brothers decided to let all of us know with a video that has gone viral. As a homeless man sat in the streets of New York asking for money for food, the youngest brother Omar sat next to him and pretended to be homeless.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvoWBbYxdwc]As people passed by, it was young Omar who who was getting money in his cup while the homeless veteran received nothing. At one point, after a policewoman put money in Omar s cup, the veteran asked her for money, saying that he had nothing to eat the entire day. Annoyed, the policewoman sternly said that she works every day and that he s a grown man and then flicked his hat.Another passerby was even more abusive. After he gave Omar some money, the veteran asked for some change to which the man said,  This little kid out here. They don t know what it takes. You re a grown ass man. I got a job. I work my ass off every day.  The veteran replied,  I served my country sir.  The man then said,  You served your country! Here is something that served your country!  He then spilled the food he was carrying all over the veteran.Yet, despite being humiliated and crying, the veteran stood up, walked a few feet to a restaurant, and came back with two slices of pizza, one for him and for Omar.That s when the two brothers of Omar came up to the veteran and told him that Omar was not homeless. They gave him all of the money Omar had collected and an additional $200. Surprised and crying, the veteran and the brothers exchanged hugs.We don t know why this man who served his country is homeless, but war is damaging both physically and psychologically. What we do know is that he was extremely kind hearted to Omar despite the humiliation he suffered at the hands of strangers.One thing that we should learn from this video is that we need to take care of our veterans.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Police Investigating Possible Attempt To Murder Bernie Sanders (VIDEO),"Since at least September, people have been calling for Secret Service protection for Bernie Sanders, noting that he is vulnerable to   potentially violent confrontations with disturbed people.  With the Right s almost devout adherence to their misunderstanding of socialism and conservative politicians  desperate attempts to equate Democratic Socialism with National Socialism (After all, a man who wants to make education affordable, help the poor, and rebuild our infrastructure is just like Hitler).It seems as though people who are concerned with Sanders  safety are correct   because on Thursday, someone shot up his Nevada campaign office while the Senator was in town. Winning Democrats reports that campaign staffers found a bullet hole in the window of the Las Vegas headquarters on Thursday morning, the same day the Senator was on site.So far, the bullet has not been located, but Metro Police took a report for malicious destruction of property and are investigating the shooting. Police confirmed that a bullet appeared to have gone through the window, but were unwilling to confirm that a shot had been fired, according to the Las Vegas Sun.The Sanders campaign declined to comment on the shooting.Numerous petitions have been circulating for months asking that Sanders be given a Secret Service detail. After all, Hillary Clinton has one. Donald Trump has one. Even Ben Carson has Secret Service protection. To date, while Trump has allowed and even encouraged violence and threats at his rallies, all of it was directed at people he didn t like   African-Americans, Hispanics, and Muslims. Only Sanders has had someone attempt to whack him. According to the Secret Service website, Sanders certainly qualifies. Candidates must:Be publically announcedHave some degree of prominence as shown by opinion pollsBe actively campaigning and entered in at least 10 state primariesBe seeking the nomination of a qualified partyHave qualified for matching funds in the amount of at least $100,000Have received contributions totaling $10 millionSanders is, of course, publicly announced. While Clinton is winning in the polls, Sanders has continually shown  some degree of prominence. Prior to 1968, candidates did not receive Secret Service protection. However, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, things changed. We began protecting major candidates like Clinton, Sanders, and Trump   and even people who don t stand a chance like Ben Carson. He is certainly registered in at least 10 state primaries. He s seeking the nomination of the most qualified party, and he qualifies for matching funds. He has also received donations well over $10 million.It s time we demand that Sanders receive Secret Service protection   after all, he s the one people seem to be shooting at.Watch a news report on the attack below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws3ajM_CEYc?rel=0&showinfo=0]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Barbaric Bullies Set Disabled 13-Year-Old Boy On Fire (VIDEO),"Deandre Williams suffers from a disability which causes him to walk with a limp. Because of his condition, his mother says, a group of student bullies routinely picked on and bullied him, even giving him the nickname  limpy. Shortly before Christmas, this same group of students invited the teen to the community center, supposedly to hang out. The 13-year-old then went with the group to the home of one of the student bullies.Once inside the house, one of the students doused him in cologne and then lit him on fire. He was trying to leave, run out of the house but he can t because he can t run. He walks with a limp,  his mother, Ursula Allen, told Fox 5 in New York.According to Allen, there were others in the house at the time the attack occurred, including the mother and the sister of the student who set her son on fire.Although Deandre had severe burns on his face, neck, chest and arm, more than two hours past before anyone attempted to get medical attention for the injured teen. When the sister saw what was going on she covered it up,  Allen said.  She put Deandre in the shower which hurts even more. The teen was later admitted to the hospital in critical condition, due to the severity of his injuries.Here s more on this story from Fox 5.The attack on Deandre Bloomfield took place in Staten Island, New York on December 2nd.During an interview with New York Daily News on December 9, the teen said he thought the boy who attacked him was his friend. He used to bully me. Smack me around,  he said during the interview, which took place in his room at Staten Island University Hospital North.The teen described what happened on the night of the attack. First he smacked me. I got up and I said,  Don t smack me again.  And when I wanted to leave, he picked up a perfume bottle with a lighter, and he sprayed it on me. He did it two times. The first time he did it sparked on me. . . . And that s when I started to run, and he threw the whole bottle at me. His clothes caught on fire.Deandre s attacker, another 13-year-old boy, was not identified by police, due to his age. He was arrested and faces multiple charges.No charges have been filed against the boy s mother or sister, although police say they are still investigating the incident.After spending almost three weeks in the hospital, Deandre was released just before Christmas. Community organizations pulled together to send a message of support and healing to the teen, who also opened an assortment of awesome Christmas gifts, including an xbox one, OVO clothes, gear and more, courtesy of rapper Drake and radio station Hot 97.1.During an interview with the station on January 8, Deandre said he won t be able to go back to school for another few weeks yet. He still has some healing to do. When asked whether he felt safe going back to the same school, he said the students who bullied and attacked him are no longer attending classes there.According to the National Education Association (NEA) bullying impacts more than 13 million students in the United States annually. Every day in the U.S. more than 160,000 kids stay from home school because of bullying.If you think a child is being bullied, the NEA advises against just ignoring the signs, hoping the behavior will correct itself. Instead, the organizations advises adults to intervene as soon as they suspect there is a problem.The NEA says parents should: Take any and all steps to address bullying including getting professional help. And be sure to inform someone in your child s school that your child is being bullied. It s crucial that parents have a contact person in the school whether it be a principal or assistant principal, a teacher or a support staff person. *Featured image credit: video screen capture via Fox 5",News,"January 10, 2016"
 Experts: ‘Militiamen’ Live Hand To Mouth On Gov’t Disability And Their Wives’ Hard Work,"Jon Ritzheimer, infamous right-wing terrorist and incredible douchebag, barely squeaks by on his government disability check and has said that he is  thankful to have a wife who works.  As it turns out, experts tell us that this guy who spends his days fighting imaginary battles and sucking up a good man s oxygen isn t the exception to the demographics that make up a right-wing terrorist militia, he s the definition. These guys are broke,  said Mark Pitcavage, who has been researching far-right movements for 22 years and has studied the Harney County occupiers.  Right-wing extremists, generally speaking, have very little money. How a right-wing extremist occupation like the one in Oregon would pay for itself isn t exactly an issue there s been a lot of data on. By referencing the research of people like Pitcavage, we can deduce that right-wing extremists are for the most part freeloaders, likened to teenagers who think they can take care of themselves but overwhelmed the first time they have to pay a bill or do a load of laundry. It s quite possible that a lot of them will get tired and feel the pressure to go back and care for their families,  Pitcavage explained. Those families, left behind to care for themselves, are probably better off without their  patriarch,  the almighty man who controls everything and can make the decision to just pack up and leave on a whim to occupy a forest a thousand miles away that they ve never heard of before last week.Daryl Johnson, a former DHS domestic terrorism analyst, says militia members have a warped sense of priority where their duty  is concerned. A video released by Ritzheimer showed him crying that he would probably be killed and how much he would miss his family just before he held up a copy of the Constitution and declared  But I took an oath. They ll think nothing about taking half their paycheck and using half of it to buy ammunition and guns,  Johnson told The Oregonian.The gist here is that these idiots aren t just the worst the American gene pool has to offer, they re also incredible assholes who are neglecting their families to go play soldier in the Oregon wilderness. They re holed up in a facility they didn t pay to be at, squeezing the taxpayer for their utilities and costing tens if not hundreds of thousands more in wages paid to employees who can t go to work.The sooner these imbeciles are removed and incarcerated the better off the country   and their families   will be.Featured image via thetruthaboutguns.com",News,"January 9, 2016"

Talk about a formula for a  shootout! The double standard is clear.Instead, the Bundy boys, along with their bearded homies, have been coddled by law enforcement. Although they haven t created the so-called change they ve been asking for they have become celebrities, getting airtime on a host of news outlets throughout the standoff.

 People Are Posting Photos Of Their Food To Mock Starving People In Syria (IMAGES/VIDEO),"According to The Independent, people who support the regime in Syria are sharing pictures of food on social media in an attempt to taunt starving civilians trapped in a town currently being bombed in Syria. The town of Madaya, a holdout for opposition forces, has been held under siege for six months by the Syrian government.

 WATCH: Ted Cruz Tells Social Worker He’s Going To Deport Her If He Becomes President (VIDEO),"During a  Cruzin  to the Caucus  campaign event in Iowa on Thursday night, Ted Cruz was questioned by a young woman who is concerned that she may be deported if Cruz is elected president.According to the Washington Post, Ofelia Valdez is a 30-year-old woman, who works as a special needs social worker and activist. Her parents brought her into the United States when she was a child illegally. She tells Cruz that she is currently safe from being deported because of President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program mandates that homeland security focus their attention on high priority individuals who have come into the United States illegally. High priority targets are people who have a violent criminal record. DACA makes it so that government agencies are not wasting resources going after people who more than likely were brought here by their parents, and have lived here for most of their lives. I think of myself as a part of this community and you know, first day of presidency, you decide to deport, you know, people like myself, you know, it s just very difficult,  said Valdez.Cruz has vowed to reverse the executive orders made by the President during the Obama administration. It doesn t seem to matter what those executive orders are, Obama made them so they are bad. So Cruz responds, essentially telling the woman that he would deport her, should he become president. If you re a DACA recipient, you were brought here illegally, and violating the law has consequences. One of the problems of our broken immigration system is that it is creating human tragedies and there are human tragedies when people break the law,  Cruz says.Cruz then goes on to list a number of other nations that he seems to think have a singular, hegemonic system for immigration, that represents the entire world.  This is met with thunderous applause from the other attendees at the event.You can watch a video from the event below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 9, 2016"
" Mark Zuckerberg Supports Vaccinations, And Anti-Vaxxers Are Super Pissed About It (IMAGE)","Mark Zuckerberg has a daughter, and unlike parents involved in the anti-vaxxer movement, he s a responsible parent who cares about the health of his kid and those around her.The Facebook founder posted a photo of himself holding his daughter Max in a doctor s office waiting for vaccinations.

We all care about our kids. Growing up, my mom s best friend had a perfectly healthy daughter. She received MMR and had a grand mal seizure and suffered brain damage. Her dr diagnosed her with vaccine injury. She was left unable to talk or walk for the rest of her life. So that was MY first personal experience with vaccines. Bottom line A pharmaceutical that carries at least a risk of harm to some, should never be mandated. Because, in the end, no one seems to care about the  sacrifices  made for the  common good. Another woman named Colleen Kennedy wrote furiously that  herd immunity is a myth  and proceeded to try and scare people by listing the ingredients of the vaccine as if this has not been public knowledge for years.Others attacked the pharmaceutical industry for allegedly created epidemics so that they can sell more vaccines. You know, crazy ravings from paranoid people.As we all know, measles became a national story once again as the virus became an epidemic in this country, especially in California where many parents send their unvaccinated kids to school. Measles had been largely wiped out in this country by 1997, but because of anti-vaxxers, measles made a comeback and killed an American for the first time in 12 years.The MMR vaccine is one of the most successful preventive measures a parent can take to keep their kids healthy. Not only is measles the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, it s deadlier than the Ebola virus that sent Americans over the edge with fear in 2014. Even Fox News  own medical expert strongly endorsed vaccines and ripped anti-vaxxers a new one when asked about the new epidemic.Mark Zuckerberg is being a responsible parent and leading by example that he doesn t fear vaccines and trusts science. Other parents would be wise to follow suit for the sake of their own children.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 9, 2016"

 Bundy Terrorists Claim God Told Them To Act Like Toddlers And Take Over Wildlife Refuge,"Ammon Bundy and his wayward crew of temper tantrum-throwing white guys with guns are now claiming that God talked to them and told them to seize the federal wildlife refuge.On Friday, Bundy told a meeting of fellow right-wing domestic terrorists that he refuses to end the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge because  the Lord  told him to go there in the first place. I was asked to do this by the Lord. I did it how he told me to do it. It sounds like Bundy and his band are suffering from a form of mental illness. Because the Mormon church that Bundy is a member of sure doesn t agree with him.In a statement earlier this month, officials from the Church of Latter-day Saints rejected Bundy s claim that his seizure of federal property had anything to do with religion. Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. Exactly, and that is why we can no longer tolerate this armed occupation. Bundy and his pals are committing treason and domestic terrorism. They have illegally carried guns on federal property, along with breaking and entering and threatening violence against federal officials. They have forced the town of Burns to live in fear as schools and businesses are closed to avoid putting innocent children and adults in harm s way.If Bundy and his group were a bunch of armed black people or Muslims, federal and local law enforcement would have already riddled the building with bullets on the first day and Ammon Bundy would look like Swiss cheese.But because these guys are white rednecks with guns, law enforcement is giving them free reign to do as they please. Bundy thinks him and his buddies should be able to walk free when this is all over and they assume the government will give in to their demands. If that were to happen, nothing will stop these terrorists from becoming more emboldened in the future. Perhaps they ll set their sights on the Capitol building or the White House next.This armed takeover has been totally unjustified from the very beginning. Not only have Dwight and Steven Hammond, the arsonist ranchers whom Bundy says he is fighting for, rejected his cause, history and the law are firmly against him as well.Bundy claims the federal government stole the land from ranchers, but that is far from the case.According to Oregon Live, the federal government has legally held the title to all public lands in Oregon since it was a territory. After exhaustive research, the Supreme Court also ruled in 1902 and 1935 that this is the case. Furthermore, ranchers have willingly sold and been paid fair value for their land by the federal government to expand the wildlife reserve over the years.In short, the Bundys do not have religion, history, nor the law on their side. They are terrorists, pure and simple, and they need to be arrested and thrown in prison, or treated just like we have treated terrorists in the Middle East, who ironically enough also claim religion justifies their cause.Featured Image: WMUR",News,"January 9, 2016"
 How Fox News Helped Domestic Terrorists,"In the first year of President Obama s term in office, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning about the threat of domestic terrorism. Immediately, Fox News and the rest of the conservative media   Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and other talk radio figures   slammed the document and were soon followed by Republican members of congress.Overly sensitive to the hue and cry from the right in those early days, then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano withdrew the report and the unit behind it was disbanded.Since then, America has had several instances of right-wing terrorism, from the South Carolina church shooting to the murder of police in Las Vegas and the Bundy clan s repeated armed run-ins with federal authorities.Daryl Johnson is the Homeland Security analyst who worked on the report, and he says that pull back has made things dangerous.On Friday, the department announced a task force with the Justice Department to focus on countering homegrown extremists radicalized by foreign groups such as the Islamic State, drawing staff members from dozens of federal and local agencies. It is unclear if the group would investigate domestic antigovernment groups. The D.H.S. is scoffing at the mission of doing domestic counterterrorism,  Mr. Johnson said.  The same patterns that led to the growth of the antigovernment groups in the 1990s is being played out today. D.H.S. should be doing more. In case you have forgotten the growth of those right wing groups in the 1990s   again, under a Democratic president they accused of  tyranny,  we had the Oklahoma City bombing, which until 9/11 was the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and is still the second most deadly attack of its kind. 169 people died and over 680 people were injured.Even worse, today s mainstream conservatives are espousing many of the radical ideas of the extremist movement. What once was way out on the fringe has now manifested in Republican lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Governor Greg Abbott calling for a  convention of the states,  echoing Confederate-era arguments about diluting the federal government and leaving more up to right-wing state governments.Thanks to Fox News browbeating the government into downplaying this very real threat to Americans, we could face a major loss of life.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Gotta Love It When Idiot Conservatives Accidentally Reveal People HATE The NRA,"Conservatives alongside right-wing media outlets are trying desperately to spin the gun debate in their favor. They know that the majority of Americans support President Obama s executive actions on guns, so they need to make it look like people don t want them.One conservative media outlet, Breitbart, decided to run an article with this title: OBAMA S QUANDARY: NRA GAINING SUPPORT, GUN CONTROL LOSING IT Screengrab via BreitbartHowever, within the text of the article they try to piece together some sort of magic way of showing Americans support the NRA, but instead fail miserably, stating: In 1987, twenty-seven percent of Americans strongly supported the NRA. In December 2015, that number had risen to 38 percent. In order words, over one-in-three Americans  strongly support  the NRA. In other other words, two-in-three Americans do NOT support the NRA. It doesn t seem smart to write an article about how terribly Obama is doing and then point out with numbers how more than half the nation is actually on his side and not yours. Bravo for that. Well done.They also point out: In addition to these things, the American people are voting with their feet by walking into gun stores all around the country and buying firearms at a record pace. Figures from the FBI show that 2015 set a record for the number of background checks performed in a single year, with 23,141,970 checks performed. But then reiterate: So the NRA enjoys the  [strong] support  of more than one-in-three Americans while support for gun control is losing ground. WSJ suggests that this put Obama in a position where he had to go it alone. No, the NRA enjoys the reward of paying off members of Congress to make sure President Obama and the rest of America doesn t get the chance to hurt gun profits. Oh, and all this hysteria over FBI background checks really proves is a strong amount of paranoia from the one-third of Americans who actually think guns are a solution or are deceived into thinking they ll lose their firearms.In regards to actual support for stricter gun laws, data proves that is actually up drastically with more than 55% of Americans saying they want laws on gun sales more strict:There are facts, and then there s how one interprets facts. Breitbart chose to report only one-third of Americans strongly support the NRA, but anyone with a rationally thinking brain can decipher that this also means that two-thirds of Americans don t. They also want you to believe citizens don t want stricter gun laws, but, in fact, they do.Truth is, we need stricter laws on gun sales to make sure the wrong people don t get their hands on guns. This includes mental health background checks. If you re a law-abiding citizen without a history of mental illness, guess what   NONE of your rights will be  infringed  because you ll still be able to purchase your precious paranoia machines firearms. And just like laws regarding cars and driving don t stop every accident, they sure as hell prevent a lot, just like better gun laws would prevent unnecessary deaths as well.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Kentucky Republicans Propose Bill To Delay School Year To Accommodate Creationist Museum,"Kentucky Republicans have decided to put the profits of a creationist museum ahead of the education of their state s children, and that just about says it all.At the very start of 2016 s legislative year, Kentucky conservatives introduced a bill, SB-50, that would keep schools closed until the end of August in order to allow the state s brand new  Noah s Ark  museum to eke out a few more weeks of the tourist season. Priorities!Writer Dan Arel has been following the situation, in all its mind-numbing stupidity, for the better part of a year. He writes:As I reported back in August of 2015, Kentucky Sen. Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, and Sen. Chris Girdler, R-Somerset had proposed such a bill to help extend the vacation season to bring more attention to the forthcoming Ark Encounter. Grant County is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the Ark,  Thayer said.  But there won t be many families from Kentucky visiting in August if we continue with the current calendar. And while other states have set their school schedule around economic issues, you d be hard-pressed to find a state do that to satisfy the bottom-line of a single man.Meet Ken Ham, the right-wing creationist famous for his creation museum and infamous for getting absolutely demolished in a debate with Bill Nye. He and his giant Ark have Kentucky s Republican-led legislature wrapped around his finger.Lately, Ham has been so busy hurling hatred at gay people that one might forget that he makes most of his money by running a religious-based creation museum and associated ministry in Kentucky. In the past few years, Ham has set his sights on expanding his museum to feature a  life-sized  mock up of Noah s Ark. After a ton of fundraising   and a few charges of tax fraud   Ham opened his Ark in November, 2015.To give you an idea of how obnoxious Ham can be, this is how he chose to announce his big Grand Opening ceremony set to begin this summer: We are so excited that the construction progress and schedule landed on this 7/7 date. Genesis 7:7 states that Noah and his family entered the Ark. So it s fitting we allow the public to enter the life-size Ark on 7/7. Ham s enablers in Kentucky want to extend the park s  vacation season  to September. They hope this will bring in more money, but what they don t mention is that almost none of it would be coming back to the state. Ham, for all of his religious-speak, is primarily a huckster. He continues to label his for-profit  ministry  a tax-exempt church, and therefore pays little to no taxes. Keeping kids out of school so their parents can buy tickets for Ham s park does nothing but make students in the state more ignorant, residents poorer, and Ham richer.Schools, obviously, are not happy, either. As Ham continues to count his dollars, teachers and principals are left scrambling for a way to salvage the potentially lost time. One principal was hopeful that the bill wouldn t pass, but conceded if it did, it would be a disaster.  It may help tourism, however, I think it could potentially hurt many Kentucky children. Given the fundamentalism promoted by Ham s anti-intellectual  museums,  it s safe to say the principal is being too generous. This has all the makings of an educational disaster.Feature image via Christian Post screengrab",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Ammon Bundy’s Own ‘Safety’ Committee Tells Him And His Militia Terrorists To Go Home (VIDEO),"If anything should tell the militia terrorists occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that it is time for them to give this ridiculous  occupation  up, it should be the fact that a committee that Ammon Bundy himself helped create is telling them to leave.On Friday night, the Harney County Committee of Safety, which Ammon Bundy helped form, held a townhall event in which the occupiers were told to leave. A letter from the committee told them, essentially: you made your point, now it s time for you to go home. First, spokesperson Melodi Holt seemed to try to butter the clowns up when she began speaking, telling the militia people that they did a good job by: shining a light on the Hammond case here in Harney County.Your actions have created a national focus on the Hammonds and other issues here and across the West that have created mutual distrust, anger and unrest between the people of the land and the federal government,  Molt read.  We thank you for stirring us to action. However, that was the end of the good things Holt and the committee had to say about the Bundy militia. She went on to slam the occupiers  tactics, saying that the committee and its supporters: were very upset that you chose to take the aggressive action of occupying the refuge and did it without our knowledge or any local approval, and in a fashion that has created huge distrust and loss of credibility of and for us as a group and as residents within the community. We approved of most of your message but disapprove of your unilateral methods of occupation. We ask that you organize your people, explain that your point has been made and leave in a peaceful and honorable fashion. No comment has come from the militia occupiers, and they declined to show up to the event that was essentially held to blast what they are doing.Mr. Bundy & Co., when your own people think you are doing the wrong thing, it really is time to hang it up. Go home. The local communities and residents, along with the federal government, have been more than lenient and patient with you. The committee is right. The point has been made.

" Bundy’s Anti-Government Militia Costing Taxpayers $100,000 A WEEK During ‘Indefinite’ Standoff","We already know that the citizens of Harney County do not want the Bundy militia around, but neither should the rest of us. Their stupidity is costing us a fortune.While it may seem that occupying an empty, powerless wildlife refuge during the harsh Oregon winter would be an exercise in harmless stupidity, a fuller picture is emerging that reveals the Bundys and their fellow anti-government extremists are costing America hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in tax money.The occupation of the refuge is still centered around a single building, the amount of extremists with guns marching around and threatening to shoot cops has meant nearby buildings have also had to be evacuated. The employees have been placed on paid leave for their own safety. This means that while protesting the government, the militia has caused a costly shutdown of operations that actually wastes more money than it saves.Government Executive did some digging and found that the total amount of money being paid out to employees that can no longer do their job without risk being caught in the crossfire of this ill conceived insurrection is staggering.Nearly 120 permanent and seasonal employees report to BLM s district office in Burns, Ore., nearly all of whom are now on paid administrative leave.The salaries of those workers total approximately $117,000 per week, according to a BLM spokesman. The office has already been closed for more than one week. About 50 more employees work at the refuge center or the Forest Service s Emigrant Creek Ranger District office, many of whom are also on paid leave.An official at the Harney County, Ore., joint information center   which is handling inquiries on the situation   who refused to be identified due to  security threats,  said federal officials  don t have a cost estimate yet  on the other two facility closures, noting they are dealing with a  fluid situation. In other words, the expenses are only getting worse as the siege continues and the tension mounts.Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been lost and the militia is only growing more emboldened. On January 8, the Harney County Sheriff s Department announced that negotiations have all but fallen apart and the militia appears to have dug in for the long haul.Statement from Sheriff Ward: pic.twitter.com/6fz0OenM4d  Harney Cty. Sheriff (@HarneyCoSheriff) January 8, 2016While the militia has been dismissed by some as clowns (and they are), they are still dangerous.

 Racist Moron Gets Fired For This 20 Second Video Of Him Shouting ‘Wetback’… At An Arabic Person (VIDEO),"It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers. Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it. Occasionally, the imbecile will be found and karma will collect their job, or in the very least, they re forced to quit the internet.In this case, the story has one added hilarious twist: The dumbass shouts the slur, loses his job and gets called out   and he couldn t even get it right. During his hand-clapping chorus of  Beaner! Beaner! Wetback! Wetback!  the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is. In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic. Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests. Maybe he felt if he called her something as clever as  towel head  she would detonate.Or perhaps he really is just that stupid.The man, an Oregonian identified as an employee of a small company, Wolcott Plumbing, now has bigger fish to fry. He ll be waiting in line Monday at the unemployment office. After local station KGB got hold of the video and reported on it, a company official wrote: First of all, this is a very upsetting situation. Under no circumstances do I personally nor do we as a company condone the use of abusive language of any kind to anyone. Upon further investigation today, I learned and confirmed it was one of my employees in the video. This employee was immediately terminated.

 Cruz Dedicates Empty Seat At State Of The Union To ‘50 Million Unborn Children’ Instead Of Gun Violence Victims (TWEET),"Yesterday, President Barack Obama made a touching tribute to the victims of gun violence. Just days after his executive action on gun control, Obama announced that he would be leaving an open seat at his future State of the Union address to represent every life that has been lost in senseless gun-related deaths   a sentiment that anyone who been affected by gun violence could appreciate.This move from our president isn t surprising  the Obamas have hosted family members of gun violence victims in State of the Union addresses before. Obama s empty state at the State of the Union will be in the First Lady s guest box.On a conference call with Organizing for Action, Obama explained the reason behind his gesture: We want them to be seen and understood; that their absence means something to this country. We want to tell their stories, we want to honor their memory and we want to support Americans whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence and remind every single one of our representatives that it s their responsibility to do something. Obama also reminded his supporters that  these kinds of important gestures only matter if it translates into action. Like clockwork, it didn t take long for a Republican to swoop in and ruin the moment. This time, it was Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, who decided to take the president s emotional, heartfelt remarks and turn it into a GOP talking point on abortion. Pro-birth Cruz, who has been known for his abortion and sex-related rants, tweeted this awful thing in response to Obama s tribute:Ted Cruz twitterHow sensitive. Like many of his conservative peers, Cruz has been resisting Obama s executive action hard, and making sure to add his unwanted opinion wherever and whenever possible. Currently, there is a fundraising appeal on Cruz s campaign website that claims that Obama  wants your guns  (even though Obama has repeatedly said that he believes in the Second Amendment and that legal guns will not be confiscated).Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 9, 2016"
" This Pill Is 25,000% More Expensive In America Than In India – And You Can Blame The U.S. Government For It","In 2013, Gilead Sciences Inc. filed an application with the FDA for a new drug that they claimed could cure hepatitis C. The drug was nothing short of a miracle.The new wonder drug was named Sovaldi. Where previous hep C treatments had a minimal success  rate and involved 6-12 months of grueling treatment that involved a slew of harsh side effects, Sovaldi cured people at a 94%+ rate in one 12-week treatment. It was so good, that Gilead received the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is given to drugs that show a tremendous advance over existing options and treatments.After an astonishingly fast review process and approval by the FDA, Gilead filed a patent for Harvoni which is Sovaldi combined with an NS5A inhibitor. Demand for Harvoni skyrocketed globally because currently there are approximately 130 million to 150 million people living with hepatitis C around the world.To call this a medical advance of historic proportions would be putting it mildly. The unfortunate fact is that the very thing that makes Harvoni so wonderful is what makes it absolutely terrible  if you happen to live in America.In the U.S., a 12-week course of Harvoni costs $84,000   $94,000. It works out to approximately $1000 per pill. If you lived in India, the cost per pill is $4.I get it. The cost to develop a drug can be staggering. Research and development work, plus the employees who perform it, are not free. Then there are trials and further tests. It all gets expensive. But here is the problem; Gilead didn t do any of these steps. It turns out, Sovaldi was already invented by a group called Doctors of the World at Cardiff University in 2007.DotW is claiming that Gilead merely copied their publicly funded research, rushed it through FDA approval and patenting, and then immediately jacked the price to reap an absolutely insane profit. It worked. In 2014, Gilead had a total revenue of $24.9 billion compared to $11.2 billion in 2013.Comparing this to India, you start to see the disgusting truth of it all. The Indian government denied Gilead a patent in their country, on the grounds that they couldn t prove that the drug was more effective at treating hep C than what was invented at Cardiff University in 2007. This has forced Gilead to actually compete in a free market.Due to not having a government-sanctioned monopoly in India, Gilead was forced to sell their pill at $4. This results in a total cost to save your life of about $340.For the cost of the same treatment with the same pill in America, where we have  the most amazing healthcare system in the world,  you could literally move to India, live there for about 2 years, take the drug for a few weeks during that time, get cured, then move back and still come out saving money.How freaking ridiculously insane is this?!A lawsuit was filed by Doctors of the World against Gilead as well, on the basis that the drug molecule was not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Seeing as India s regulatory agencies and patent office has already concurred with the opinion in this lawsuit, things do not look to be going well for Gilead in the future. I personally wouldn t be buying their stock.This brings us to the heart of the problem. Gilead essentially ripped off publicly funded work, copied a drug, then  innovated  by mixing it with a secondary drug to call it unique. This justified the technicalities required for a patent, but it violated the spirit for which patents are intended. If the FDA and U.S. patent office did some due diligence and used India as a precedent, denying Gilead their vulture capitalism cash cow, this would not be an issue.The FDA has a problem with revolving door crony capitalism. One example is FDA member Milton Packer, who chairs the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. Packer reviews applications for drugs submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval. He is also financed by Novartis and has spoken on their behalf to the advisory board he himself chairs. He has also gone to bat in his own committee for GlaxoSmithKline in 2003, Spoke for Sanofi in 2009, and consulted for Pfizer in 2010.Packer s activities, while part of a government board meant to impartially regulate pharmaceuticals on behalf of the nation, scream conflict of interest. And he is only one person among many who participate in this sort of nonsense.Government involvement in a market, especially one like pharmaceuticals, is desperately needed. However, when that government involvement ends up being corrupted to where it serves the needs of corporations over people, it becomes a government-sanctioned monopoly that is enforcible by law.Real progressive regulatory and patent reform is so desperately needed in America, and any presidential candidate who is serious about helping the middle class should make it a primary focus of their campaign.Featured image via drugs.com",News,"January 9, 2016"
 BUSTED: Guess What The Bundy Militia Was Doing While They Were Not In Gunfights With The FBI,"Oregon Public Broadcasting just busted the Bundy militia using government computer systems and accessing federal employee data within the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.In a rather serendipitous occurrence, the blue tarp man himself   LaVoy Finicum   was leading OPB reporter John Sepulvado through the building on a tour, explaining what their plans were for the building. That s when Finicum led him right into something none of the militia wanted anyone to see.Finicum led Sepulvado into a computer room that was part of the wildlife refuge compound. He explained to Sepulvado that the militia planned to convert it into a  media room  to house reporters who they expected to come to the site.That s when it all went wrong for the militia.Sepulvado observed militants interacting with government computers in the compound that can only be accessed with employee badges. Employee badges were also strewn about the room, laying out in plain sight, along with papers that had names and Social Security numbers on them.Finicum immediately realized how badly he screwed the pooch by allowing the OPB reporter to see what they were doing, and for good reason. Their activities likely will fall under the Computer Fraud And Abuse Act which carries some serious penalties (fines and up to 10 years in prison) for what they were doing.Finicum made a mad dash to pick up all the papers full of personal information and ID cards and hid them away. Shortly after that, Ryan Bundy entered the room.Bundy emphatically denied that anything had been touched since they began their occupation of the compound: No, we haven t touched a single personal item. We haven t touched any of the computers, we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything. We re not here to hurt people. Not even the people who work here. This is where I call BULLSH*T. I ll bet any amount of cash that federal employees do not make a habit of having reams of papers, covered in very sensitive and personal information just laying about on their desks as a normal part of their workday. I will also bet that if they were to do something like this, it would be once in a blue moon and they would put it away before the left for the day. The same goes with the ID cards. If they were the key to using a computer, there is no doubt that any activities would be tied to the card used to access a terminal, and any misuse would fall on the individual who was assigned the card. There s no way employees would leave them laying around like that.The stupidity of the militia, bringing a reporter into what is essentially an ongoing crime scene, would almost be comical, except for one really serious detail.Law enforcement officials informed OPB that prior to the occupation, federal employees and family members of local law enforcement had received anonymous threats. Harney County Sheriff David Ward said that his own deputies and family members had been followed home by unknown individuals, photographed, and had property damaged in recent months.There are 17 employees that work at the refuge. All of these people could have had their personal information, home addresses, phone numbers, emergency family contacts, and God knows what else stolen and disseminated by a group of militants with too many bullets and too few brains. Up till this point, things were a good laugh. Now  not so much.Featured image via OPB",News,"January 9, 2016"
" Muslim Woman Kicked Out Of Trump Rally Speaks Out: They Asked, ‘Do You Have A Bomb?’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s rally are a hotbed of bigotry, and that was proven at his latest event in Rock Hill, South Carolina. A Muslim woman, Rose Hamid, 56, attended, and she says she had some predictably horrific encounters before Trump s goons finally threw her out for no reason other than the fact that she is Muslim. Speaking to CNN s Don Lemon, Hamid said: One guy was saying,  Get out   do you have a bomb? Do you have a bomb?  I said,  No. Do you have a bomb?  They were saying ugly, ugly things. One guy was saying,  God is great.  I said,  Yeah, God is great. Though Hamid wore a shirt that expressed peaceful intentions, she and another man were escorted from the event by a police officer. To make matters worse, Trump himself seized the opportunity to stoke the fires of hate and bigotry in his ignorant base, saying as they were removed by a cop: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Hamid summed the experience up perfectly when she told Don Lemon that Trump s repeated Islamophobia and hate speech is a vivid example of what happens when you start using this hateful rhetoric and how it can incite a crowd. Lemon asked Hamid what most folks would ask a person who goes into a lion s den of hate deliberately: Some people would say,  Why even put yourself in that position, Rose? To be around those people. Hamid s response was one of wisdom and bravery: Because I don t want to think of them as  those people. I think that s what the problem is, that we look at people and we categorize them as  those people  who are bad people and  these people  are the good people. I believe that people in all camps are decent people as we get to know them. Well, she has more faith in humanity   and especially in Donald Trump supporters   than I do. Hopefully, on some level, Rose Hamid is right and I am wrong.Watch video of the interview below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Watch What Happens When a Muslim Woman Shows Up At A Donald Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has managed to attract the most racist and Islamophobic of American voters. That was all on display in Rock Hill, South Carolina, at a Friday night campaign rally when a Muslim woman, 56-year-old Rose Hamid, was thrown out by Trump security.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0Otof0wow]Rose, dressed in traditional Islamic dress and a t-shirt that read  I come in Peace,  was sitting in the stands directly behind Trump when Trump supporters, at the urging of his campaign staff, began to chant Trump s name after Rose stood up when Trump suggested that Syrian refugees were affiliated with ISIS. Rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled, which eventually led to her removal by Trump s security.Hamid later said that she  came to the rally to let Trump supporters see what a Muslim looks like so I figured that I d give them the opportunity to meet one. She said that many were shouting  epithets  at her. She said that one man yelled,  You have a bomb, you have a bomb. Trump made an ironic comment at her, making the victim of the night the victimizer. Trump said: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Major Steven Thompson of the Rock Hill Police Department said that Hamid was removed  from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that  anybody who made any kind of disturbance  should be immediately ejected.However, it s clear from the video that Hamid was not making a disturbance. It s become commonplace for Trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti-Islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country.This is Trump s America, and as can clearly be seen from the video, if this person gets to power, we are all in trouble.Featured image via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Elizabeth Warren Rips Into Jeb Bush For Taking ‘Disgusting’ Money (IMAGES),"Elizabeth Warren may not be in the spotlight as often as she used to be, but we assure you she s still there, fighting away. Anytime she sees something that doesn t quite look right; you can bet she s the last person in a room afraid to speak up about   especially when big banks are involved.On Friday, Senator Warren was reading a story like the rest of us mere Earthlings, and was so outraged by it that she took to her Facebook page for a viral call out. Her target? Jeb Bush, his super PAC, and Former AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg.The billionaire Republican donor just gave $10 million to the Right to Rise group to keep Jeb from falling out of the race. It s basically keeping him alive to duel it out just before the nation s first primaries begin. But   that s not the reason for her dissatisfaction. It turns out; Warren still has a bitter taste in her mouth stemming from the economic collapse of 2008, which saw his company receive a  huge bailout from the Bush administration  after doing a disservice to the American people. She doesn t forget these things it seems.Her full post is featured below, but this part of it is the most headline-worthy, without a doubt: I m not sure what s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother s bailout money, or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections. Pic via Facebook.The Wall Street Journal first reported the contribution on Thursday, although he refused to talk about it in an interview with them. We wonder why. You feel strongly enough about the man to give him $10 million, but don t want to talk about it? Strange.Senator Rand Paul also saw the irony in it, as well. He tweeted out almost a full day before Senator Warren how odd it was for Bush to be accepting money to  bail out his campaign,  especially when that money came from  his brother s bailout money. Pic via Twitter.Why does anyone seem surprised? This is just politics as usual. You scratch my back; I ll scratch yours. It s worked this way forever. Heck, it s even legal. Bush used to work as an  advisor  getting paid millions from investment banks just shortly after he left the Governor s office in 2007. It s not like he s expected to do any special favors for all these generous contributions he s receiving from these big banks. People need to lighten up.**If you didn t catch the sarcasm in that last part, we promise to do a better job next time.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 9, 2016"
 Governor Of Texas Unveils Detailed Plan To OVERTHROW The Federal Government,"There s something stirring in the Deep South that is reminiscent of when the South decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property. Some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government.Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R), knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states, due to this little thing called Article 6 Section 2 of the United States Constitution, has decided to release a plan to change the Constitution. This is in an effort to change the rule of law in the United States and prohibit Congress, the Supreme Court and the president from regulating states. He seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the Constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws.Abbott, in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law.  However, it seems he would rather not have federal law at all. Honestly? The next step after this would be secession. It looks like Abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another Civil War.Abbott, with his own interpretation of the Constitution put out a press release that stated:Governor Greg Abbott today delivered the keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation s Annual Policy Orientation where he unveiled his Texas Plan to restore the Rule of Law and return the Constitution to its intended purpose. In his plan, Governor Abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the States and the United States. The Governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a Convention Of States. The increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,  said Governor Abbott.  We are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution. Governor Abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in Washington, D.C. stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the Constitution. Congress routinely violates its enumerated powers, while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another. The President exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy-handed regulations. And the Supreme Court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation. Governor Abbott urged action by Texas   and other states   to restore the Rule of Law in America.Governor Abbott offered the following constitutional amendments:Prohibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.Require Congress to balance its budget.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.The full plan can be found here.The one who seems to not want to follow the Constitution is Gov. Abbott himself. If he did he wouldn t want to amend the Constitution as it is written. He s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today. He wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government. If this isn t treason, I don t know what is.What Abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers, THAT is how we can change federal laws. We don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state. That s what the South did before the Civil War when they wanted to own humans as property, and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality. What he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the United States of America. The South lost then, and he will lose now.It looks as though Abbott is trying to be the next Jefferson Davis and lead a new brand of Confederate States.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Weird: Ted Cruz Fantasizes About Spanking Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz again showed that his campaign is weirder than previous conservative Republican efforts by publicly fantasizing about spanking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Cruz revealed his spanking fantasy while rehashing the favored conservative conspiracy theory about Clinton doing something nefarious with her emails. In this iteration, Cruz echoed earlier conservative claims that Clinton was involved in a wide-ranging cover-up of the Benghazi terrorist attack in Libya.In response, Cruz said, Clinton deserved  spanking  for supposedly covering up what happened on the fateful night of the attack.A woman in the audience had asked:  For three and a half years people in Washington have been skirting around Benghazi and no one has been held accountable. I want to know what you would do. Someone needs to pay. Ma am you are exactly right. What happened in Benghazi is a national disgrace. Four Americans were murdered. We lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the Carter administration,  Cruz said.  The immediate response of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception, obstruction and cover up. They began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video, but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again, keep us safe. Cruz  added:  We do know Hillary told her daughter Chelsea, well gosh, I knew it was a terrorist attack, while we were out telling the American people it wasn t. You know I ll tell you, in my house, if my daughter Catherine, the five-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. In addition to lying about the Obama administration response to the attack   President Obama referred to it as an  act of terror  almost immediately after the event   Cruz s conspiracy echoes other sexist belittling of Clinton that has become mainstream on the right.She has often been compared to Lady Macbeth and other infamous women who have orchestrated events as conservatives have often been flummoxed in their quest to attack her and tie her in to one conspiracy or another.Cruz is doing well in Iowa, and could consolidate enough of the fundamentalist right-wing  Christian  vote their to achieve a victory, but his har right persona is almost guaranteed to face electoral failure everywhere outside the solid red enclaves of the south. Indulging in a public fantasy about spanking Clinton will not help that cause.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016"
 You’ll Never Guess Which Conservative Blowhard Compared Trump To Hitler (VIDEO),"As you re probably aware already, Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill   Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor, yet another Bill   Bill O Reilly   along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, reviewed the video. At the tail end of the segment, O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino,  [B]y making Hillary Clinton the focus, and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby, Monica Lewinsky.  O Reilly continued,  You know, I don t know if Hitler made it, but you know, he might have. It s crazy. So, yes, Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler. Frankly, I don t quite know how to feel about this. On one had, O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand, O Reilly isn t totally wrong. Obviously, there s only one Hitler, and I ve resisted the urge to go there, but the ad is classic propaganda, the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign. Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels, Hitler s minister of propaganda. But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again, if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial, I m all for it. If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads, and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly, thanking him for the easy win, they re insane. This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November. Thanks, O Reilly.Via Media Matters: Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 8, 2016"
" Captain ‘Murica: Civil War – Theft, Fraud, Booze And Brawling Are Wrecking The Bundy Revolution","The next American Revolution ended before it ever started, by the hands of the very  patriots  that claimed they were ready to die for the freedom poachers and arsonists.Ammon Bundy s occupation of misfit militiamen is already starting to fracture apart because they just can t seem to get along with each other. Brawling, fraud, theft, booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in Oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality TV show ever.Blaine Cooper, whose real name is Stanley Blaine Hicks, was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch. The victim of the assault, Jeff Kagan, quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed 911 after the assault. No reason was given for the assault, other than the fact Kagan walked from his camp across the street, towards the main militia gathering area. When he approached the area, Cooper attacked both Kagan and one other individual. Cooper also attacked one of a 3-member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from PTSD. Allegations were made that Cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities, by exploiting his PTSD and suicidal tendencies. While Cooper appears to still be there, he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers. Count him as about 3 to 4 lost members.Self-titled  Captain  Joe O Shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel. This caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members, such as John Ritzheimer. After all the booze money was gone, the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign.Brian  Booda  Cavalier, who goes by the name Fluffy Unicorn (yes he really does) has also been forced out of the militia as well. This happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the US Marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life. Cavalier was the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy for a time.The infamous  blue tarp man  LaVoy Finicum, is also leaving the gathering, despite his allegations that the FBI will arrest him if he does. I need to get home. I got cows that are scattered and lost,  Finicum was quoted as saying. Clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them.Initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around 150 individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well. The group was actually 15 people and now it is down to 12 without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows.Perhaps the first Bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new. Who really knows? With luck, these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance.Featured image via WMUR",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Republican Presidential Candidate Reveals Their New Plan To Starve The Poor,"Jeb Bush just unveiled a key component of his welfare reform package. The Republican presidential candidate wants to completely scrap the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. It should be noted that  Right to Rise  is the name of Bush s Super PAC.Bush wants to replace those programs with one that gives states  Right to Rise  grants, to support state-run programs aimed at alleviating poverty. Bush refers to the current programs in place as  failed programs  of the war on poverty, on account of there being 47 million people who are still poor in the United States. In the place of these failed programs, states will be given Right to Rise Grants. These grants will allow states to meet the needs of poor families, in the way that makes most sense in each state. As governor of Florida, I saw first-hand how states could be the laboratories of democracy. I know that giving states more flexibility will open the door for transformative ideas to eliminate poverty and increase opportunity,  Bush wrote on his campaign website, on Friday.Bush does not have any interest in reforming welfare to help fight the war on poverty. He wants to further the Republicans war against the poor. This proposal is just an attempt to dismantle the welfare system in the United States, in order to create a less efficient government.If Bush cared at all about the poor, he would support raising the federal minimum wage to a point where working people no longer need to go on assistance programs. Bush doesn t want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has publicly stated that opposes the very concept of the minimum wage. As with welfare, Bush thinks that the minimum wage is a matter for the states to work on, not the federal government. There is disagreement between economists on what effect raising the minimum wage might have on job creation, yet almost every economist agrees that raising the minimum wage would lift many people out of poverty. Now, if a candidate, Republican or otherwise, seriously wanted to reform welfare in a way that acts as scheme to lift people out of poverty, they should be looking at what Finland is doing.Featured Image Credit: USDA via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016"
 ‘American Sniper’ Widow Gets Set Straight After Telling POTUS ‘We Can’t Outlaw Murder’ (VIDEO),"Taya Kyle, the widow of infamous  American Sniper  Chris Kyle, attended CNN s  Guns in America  town hall Thursday, where she grilled President Obama on his executive actions regarding gun control and safety. Mrs Kyle, who received the  thank you  right-wingers said would never come from the president for her husband s service, took to the moment like a champ, managing to squeeze every conservative talking point possible into a few short minutes.A somewhat bizarre moment came when she told the president we  can t outlaw murder.  She presumably meant that there s no way to stop all murders from happening, so why bother trying if it will inconvenience someone with a 10-minute background check: The thing is that the laws that we create don t stop these horrific things from happening, right and that s a very tough pill to swallow. We want to think we can make a law and people will follow it, but by the very nature of their crimes they are not following it. By the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here, I don t know any of them would have been stopped by the background check and yet, I crave that desire for hope, too. Part of it is we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder, because the people who are murdering, right, are   they are breaking the law but they also don t have a moral code that we have, so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. Mrs. Kyle and those who think like her probably thought her point was some form of a slam-dunk   that the president wouldn t be able to answer. That turned out to not be the case, as her argument is based in NRA myths and lies and not in the reality that we all live every day.She does make some interesting points about the direction the country has been traveling when it comes to violent crime but stops short of reasonable when she says we should be celebrating the dropping murder rates in our country. The president agreed that we don t put enough emphasis on the good that we ve done, but that s because there s still so much horror happening every day.He s right. We can t simply say,  hooray for us, we kill fewer people than we did in 1985, let s stop worrying about it!  We have to remain vigilant and continue to institute policies that will bring the violent crime rates even lower over the NEXT 2 decades as well. The president s actions are a part of that plan and a part of his ongoing commitment to make America safer.Watch the entire exchange between President Obama and  American Sniper  widow Taya Kyle below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 8, 2016"
" Ted Cruz Performed A Totally Awkward JFK Impression, Proving Why Conservatives Aren’t Funny (VIDEO)","Someone, at some point in time, made the mistake of telling Ted Cruz that he s a funny impressionist. If you recall, Cruz previously regaled us with a totally not-funny re-enactment of the Miracle Max scene from The Princess Bride. Correction: Cruz nearly ruined that scene for all time. There s something especially repulsive about a squishy-faced right-wing zealot hamfistedly performing a scene from one of the most beloved comedies of our time.And now, he s trying to sully the memory of one of the most beloved presidents in modern history by doing another one of his   let s face it   really, really awkward, flopsweat inducing impressions.The second place contender for the Republican nomination appeared at a diner in Iowa the other day and unexpectedly broke into his impression of John F. Kennedy.And it sucked. Sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked.Not only that, but he insisted,  JFK would be tarred and feathered and thrown out of the modern Democratic Party.  Um, no. There s no justification for that, whatsoever. Once again, Ted Cruz is totally lying. In many ways, JFK is more liberal than our current Democratic president, and he s absolutely more liberal than the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton.Cruz continued,  You know, JFK said [in JFK voice],  Some men see things as they ahhh, and ask why. I see things that nevah wuhhh, and ask  Why not? STOP! For the love of all that is holy, can someone please tell Mr. Cruz to never, ever do that again? Ever? Along those lines, stop trying to be funny, conservatives. You can t do it without sounding like Lt. Hauk from Good Morning, Vietnam.The whole thing was made worse by the fact that Cruz was flanked by one of the most extreme Republicans in Congress, Steve King. Together, they form a Voltron of awfulness   both of whom routinely exploit the proud ignorance of their supporters. I can t even imagine the seismic disaster that would ve occurred if King had launched into a Reagan impression at the same time. Suddenly the fabric of space and time would ve collapsed and formed a singularity of unfunny that not even light could escape.Again, stop it, senator.

 NRA Gets Blasted For Live-Tweeting Obama’s Town Hall Meeting Instead Of Actually Attending (TWEETS),"On Thursday night, CNN s Guns In America  town hall meeting on gun violence attracted the attendance of several gun legislation opponents, but strangely enough the most outspoken pro-gun group wasn t there to counter President Barack Obama on his executive action. Host Anderson Cooper said that the National Rifle Association (NRA) had definitely been invited, but chose not to attend. Proving that it was all talk and no action, the gun advocacy group had declined the opportunity to participate in the live Q&A session with the President, and basically forfeited their right to complain about the issues going forward. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the reason the association declined was because the meeting was just a  public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House. However, that didn t stop the NRA from whining and giving their opinion during the town hall meeting anyway. As the organization watched Obama talk about tightening background checks and closing loopholes for gun sales, the NRA decided to live-tweet the event   a choice it would immediately regret.NRA TwitterNRA TwitterNRA TwitterAs Guns In America went on, the NRA made up for its lack of physical presence by filling its Twitter feed with criticisms of Obama and shared several equally ridiculous posts from gun rights advocates. Thankfully, not everyone on Twitter is as thick-headed and came to Obama s rescue to set the NRA straight:TwitterTwitterSome even chose to remind the association to shut the f*ck up since it couldn t be bothered to confront Obama in person.TwitterObama also took some time out of the town hall to blast the NRA for backing out of the discussion and expressed his disappointment in an organization that has been so vocal against gun legislation. He said: Part of the reason I welcomed this opportunity by CNN to have a good discussion debate about it is because our position is consistently mischaracterized.   There s a reason why the NRA is not here. They re just down the street. And, since this is the main reason they exist, you d think they d be prepared to have a debate with   the president.I m happy to meet with them. I m happy to talk to them, but, the conversation has to be based on facts and truth, and what we re actually proposing, not some   you know, imaginary fiction in which Obama s trying to take away your guns.

 Heavily-Armed Man Claiming To Be Jesus Arrested After Plotting To Kidnap Obama’s Dog,"A North Dakota man was arrested Wednesday after having driven to Washington, DC with one goal in mind   getting himself a new dog. But the crazed ammosexual didn t want just any dog   he wanted Bo, the First Dog of the United States. Responding to a tip from the Secret Service, police tracked the would-be dog-napper down at a Hampton Inn near the Washington Convention Center.Scott D. Stockert, 49, of Dickinson, N.D., told police that he was armed, directing them to his pickup truck where he kept a 12-gauge pump shotgun and a bolt-action .22-caliber rifle. In addition, police found a billy club, a machete with a 12-inch blade, and 350 rounds of ammunition. He was arrested and charged with carrying a rifle or shotgun outside his home or business, which is illegal in the District of Columbia.After his arrest, Stockert told police that he was Jesus Christ, that he was the son of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and expressed displeasure with the Affordable Care Act. Stockert   or Jesus, depending on whether or not you believe him   says that he was in town to a.) kidnap Bo and b.) to announce his planned run for President and a $99 per month insurance plan. You picked the wrong person to mess with,  he told agents as he was arrested.  I will f*ck your world up. On Friday at Jesus  preliminary hearing, a judge ordered him released into a high-intensity supervision program pending a court date to be set later. Stockert is not permitted to possess any weapons   real or imitation   or to go near the White House or Capitol.Court documents don t specify why he wanted to kidnap the dog, but one thing is for certain   Bo is safe for another day. As for Stockert s presidential campaign  Well, he s already had more ideas than the entire Republican field combined. Maybe he can be the man to oust Trump as the frontrunner.

Almost anyone who owns a gun or supports the Second Amendment is a member of this legion that will rise up in fury if anyone attempts to do something as bold as study gun violence in the United States.That s the common narrative that the NRA wants people to believe. In reality, the NRA s membership is huge, somewhere between 3 million and 4.5 million people, but it is a paltry number compared to the number of gun owners in the United States. Approximately 37% of the United s States reports that either they or someone in their household owns a gun, making gun owners a minority in the United States. The exact number of people who own a gun in the United States is unclear, but that number has to be much larger than those who are a member of the NRA.When President Obama announced his plan to enact new gun control laws by using his executive powers, he claimed that gun owners would support the new gun control laws. A CNN/ORC poll reveals that he was right. The Washington Post/Wonkblog compiled the results of the poll into a chart, found below. The poll results show that a majority of people, even gun owning households and Republicans, support the new gun laws. The poll even mentioned President Obama s name during the poll, which can skew polling results, as Wonkblog pointed out. I think it is fair to say that Republicans have a tendency to have negative view of President Obama. YouGov did an experiment that showed that a mere 16 percent of Republicans supported universal healthcare when they said that President Obama supported it. When pollsters said that Donald Trump supported universal healthcare, 44% of Republicans said that they support it, too.Chart Courtesy of WaPo/WonkblogSo, if these new gun law regulations are favorably viewed by the majority and are minimal in their scope, as even the NRA admits, why couldn t they be passed through Congress? That s where the real power of the NRA starts to be seen. They just buy candidates. That s the reality of money in politics, the majority s opinion does not matter. Congressional representatives appeal to the well-funded minority, ideas of democratic rule by the majority be damned. The executive orders that President Obama plans to make law are not the actions of some despot trying to seize guns away from law abiding citizens as the NRA wants their supporters to believe. His hand is being forced to take these actions by the gun lobby who have made effective government unconscionable in the age of rule by corporate oligarchy.Featured Image Credit via The White House [Public domain], Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 8, 2016"
 The Daily Show Slams Trump And Cruz In Hilarious Double Take-Down (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah and The Daily Show had a field day with the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the funniest segments of 2016 thus far.Birtherism has come back to haunt the Tea Party in a big way as their favored candidate is now dealing with the fact that unlike President Obama, he really wasn t born in the United States. Donald Trump has been happy to point that out as Ted Cruz begins to gain in the polls. And this is comedy gold as far as Noah is concerned. The son of an American mother and a foreign father who graduated from Harvard Law School and dreamed of being president, even though   let s face it, people   he wasn t born in America. That s right, we re talking about Ted Cruz   the Canadian-born Texas senator. This even took Noah by surprise because he  didn t know that this shit could happen to Republicans, as well. Like I thought Republicans were the ones who do this, not the ones who get it done to them. This for me is like hearing that someone roofied Bill Cosby. Noah pointed out the way Trump worked the scandal into conversations and how he is particularly fond of using Twitter to launch attacks. But Noah did not let this be a one-sided scandal. In what could be fodder for Ted Cruz to use in a counterattack, Noah reminded the audience that Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter, which is true because he said he saw it on TV.Indeed, Noah did a segment last year chronicling all of the instances in which Trump has creepily talked about his daughter over the years. You can read all about it here.To conclude, Noah urged everyone to start using the hashtag #DonaldTrumpWantsToBangHisDaughter.Here s the video via Comedy Central.And the 2016 race just keeps getting more entertaining.Featured Image via Screenshot",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Cleveland School Officer Placed On Leave After HORRIBLE Message About Tamir Rice’s Mom (IMAGES/VIDEO),"An officer at a Cleveland school has come under fire after he posted a status on Facebook that called the mother of slain Tamir Rice a  stupid b*tch  and made vile, insensitive remarks about young police brutality victims.Rice, a 12-year-old from Cleveland, was shot and killed last year by police officer Timothy Loehmann, who saw him playing with a toy gun and shot the boy dead before investigating the situation fully. Last week, Loehmann was let off the hook and cleared of the charges filed against him. Two days after this announcement, Cleveland Metropolitan School District officer Matt Cicero decided to voice his opinion on Rice s case over social media. The page is no longer available, but fortunately the screenshots are. He wrote: Tamir rices momma just want money. Lets make the proper changes raise your kids not to play with fake guns stupid bitch. All this media because the are notgetting what they want  Again pleeeeze anyone who does not like what I post ..unfriendly me or block me your not worth my time. Matt CiceroThis disturbing meme was also found on his Facebook page:Matt CiceroMany people came to the innocent victim s defense, saying that Rice hadn t deserved to die just because he was playing with a toy. Cicero couldn t be reasoned out of his ignorant mindset. He responded to his critics: You pull out a gun you get shot. I don t have time to ask questions and coddle kids that wave guns around. Matt CiceroIn the past, Cicero had patrolled the school district where Rice went to school, and it s horrifying to think that someone with this attitude would be trusted enough to protect children. Cicero has been placed on administrative leave since this incident has gotten attention, however many   including Cleveland City Councilman Jeff Johnson   think Cicero should be flat-out fired. Addressing Cicero s comments, Johnson said: It s disrespectful to women, it s disrespectful to African-Americans. The fact that he s so insensitive and he s placing the blame of Tamir s death on Tamir, for me that s enough for him to be not working with children in the Cleveland school system. Cleveland Metropolitan School District spokeswoman Roseann Canfora called Cicero s comments insensitive at best. In a statement, she wrote: While we respect every employee s right to freedom of speech, with those rights comes a responsibility to do so in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to others, particularly to the people we serve.

 The White House Has Issued An Official Response To ‘Making A Murderer’ Petition For Release,"After the release of Making a Murderer by Netflix, people have been utterly mortified by the giant spotlight that s been shown on our criminal justice system. In this particular case, the criminal justice system in Wisconsin.After Steven Avery was cleared of any wrong-doing after a conviction of rape in 1985, he attempted to file a lawsuit against those who wrongfully accused him and purposefully put him into prison. However, the tables were turned once again when instead of getting the justice he deserved, he, alongside young Brendan Dassey, were accused and convicted for their alleged involvement in the murder of Teresa Halbach. The documentary series on Netflix is horrifying to watch, because it shows how vindictive the officers and lawyers involved in the case were to make sure Avery was put back into prison.A  We the People  petition was created on the White House website to ask the Obama administration to pardon Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. The petition read:Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey should be given a full pardon by President Obama for their wrongful conviction in the connection to the murder of Teresa Halbach.Based on the evidence in the Netflix documentary series  Making a Murderer , the justice system embarrassingly failed both men, completely ruining their entire lives.There is clear evidence that the Manitowoc County sheriff s department used improper methods to convict both Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey.This is a black mark on the justice system as a whole, and should be recognized as such, while also giving these men the ability to live as normal a life as possible.And because of the clear outpouring of support in favor of this petition, an official response has been given by the White House:Thank you for signing a We the People petition on the Teresa Halbach murder case, currently featured on the  Making a Murderer  documentary series. We appreciate your interest in this case.To best respond to your petition, we should go over what exactly presidential pardoning power entails.The U.S. Constitution grants the power of clemency to the President: The President   shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States. This clemency authority empowers the President to exercise leniency towards persons who have committed federal crimes. Under the Constitution, only federal criminal convictions, such as those adjudicated in the United States District Courts, may be pardoned by the President. In addition, the President s pardon power extends to convictions adjudicated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and military court-martial proceedings. However, the President cannot pardon a state criminal offense.Since Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey are both state prisoners, the President cannot pardon them. A pardon in this case would need to be issued at the state level by the appropriate authorities.While this case is out of the Administration s purview, President Obama is committed to restoring the sense of fairness at the heart of our justice system. That s why he has granted 184 commutations total   more than the last five presidents combined   and has issued 66 pardons over his time in office. They also exhibited how many sentences have been commuted by President Obama   far more than any president in recent history. They added:This Administration has taken a number of important actions to reduce the federal prison population in keeping with the President s continuing efforts to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system at all phases and to better address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. These include:In 2014, President Obama also issued an Executive Order creating a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that produced a concrete blueprint for cities and towns seeking to put in place new strategies to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve while enhancing public safety. (The Task Force s Final Report is available here.)And he has met with Americans across the country who are working to improve the criminal justice system, from law enforcement officials working to lower crime and incarceration rates, to former prisoners who are earning their second chance. Last summer, he became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. And he continues to work with Congress to pass meaningful criminal justice reform that makes the system more cost-effective, fairer, and smarter, while enhancing the ability of law enforcement to keep our communities safe.Thanks again for raising your voices. We hope you ll continue to participate on the platform.It s unfortunate that because Avery and Dassey are state prisoners they cannot be pardoned by the president. It s also unfortunate that they are in Wisconsin with the equally as corrupt Gov. Scott Walker who refuses to pardon the men. Walker s press secretary issued the cop-out response, stating:Those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court.It s not looking likely for justice to be served for Avery and Dassey, but one can still hold out hope that their convictions for their alleged involvement will be overturned.Featured image via Netflix",News,"January 8, 2016"
" Watch Maine Governor’s Racist Rant For Yourself, Then See If You Buy His Excuse (VIDEO)","Maine s Republican Governor Paul LePage became a statewide embarrassment yet again this week when he decided to blame the problem of drugs on black drug dealers from out of state.On the very same day state lawmakers were debating whether to file impeachment proceedings for LePage s previous offenses (and there are many), the Tea Party conservative was attending a town hall meeting where he decided to go WAY off script and float an outrageous theory about black people targeting Maine s white women. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  these types of guys  they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. The comments were so unbelievable that several news outlets quite literally refused to believe it had even happened  that is until Maine s public access channel aired the video.Universally loathed   LePage has the distinction of being hated by both Democrats and Republicans who know him   and already facing a strong possibility that he will be kicked out of office for a series of offenses that span everything from calling Obama a racist to verbally threatening a Democratic colleague during a legislative meeting, LePage s seasoned team of spindoctors got to work trying to frame this as anything other than what it actually is. More so than ever before, the need to lie about what happened was dire. LePage s job is on the line.His team offered up this nonsensical word salad: The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. Then LePage, getting truly desperate, went ahead and implied that he was not racist, just really, really stupid. I was going impromptu and my brain didn t catch up with my mouth,  Gov. Paul LePage said. He said he meant to say  Maine  girls and not  white  girls when he made the  slip-up. It was not intended to be race,  he added.  It was intended to be Maine. Are you buying it? Don t.For one thing, the video makes it clear that saying  young white girls  was no slip of the tongue. Watch it again. He didn t stumble over his words. He didn t misspeak. When he got on the topic of drugs, he immediately jumped to the poor  white girls. If LePage is guilty of any mistake it s that he accidentally said out loud what he clearly believes but knows better than to admit to. For a guy like LePage, who has spent his time in office viciously attacking the poor and making ugly racial comments, the idea that black drug dealers would be coming to impregnate his state s white women is a racist trope that fits right in to his worldview.Even members of his own party seem to recognize that this isn t a mere  slip-up,  but represents the acknowledgment of long simmering racist views that he uses to base his conservative policies on. One Republican critic, Lance Dutson, didn t mince words:  This is one of the most blatantly racist statements he s ever made. The scariest part? He said  one of ",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Obama Can’t Stop Winning As New Jobs Report Shows U.S. Economy Still Kicking Ass,"Today, I would hate to be a Republican strategist. Why? Because with the election only 10 months away, I have to tell my candidate that the economy is still growing robustly and shows no signs of weakness. If anything, it still has room for explosive growth even after adding another 292,000 jobs in December:The jobless rate, which has declined since topping the 10 percent mark in October 2009, is now hovering just above what economists consider full employment   the point where further declines could start to push up inflation.The average monthly gain in jobs last year were closer to the 2013 average of 199,000 a month, but short of the 260,000 figure reached in 2014. The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,  said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics.  We re getting at least 200,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis. That s quite an achievement. The only downside to this report is that there was no growth to average hourly wages. That s been the  slow  part of this slow recovery. On the plus side, once we reach the  full  employment mentioned above, wages will grow and grow rapidly. Companies will be competing for employees and the way to do that is by offering higher pay. This, by the way, is one of the reasons Corporate America has not been all that gung-ho about heating up the economy. High unemployment means low wages, the second favorite phrase next to  Golden Parachute  for CEOs.But, once wages start going up, people will have more money to spend and that increases demand. Increased demand, of course, requires more people to fill that demand and that means more jobs which means more people have money to spend and so the cycle goes. Slowing or reversing this cycle was the express purpose of the Republican s austerity mania in which they insisted pulling money out of the economy would  help  it. A crippled economy is good for Republican political ambitions.Fortunately, Obama fended off most of their bullshit cuts and instead implemented policies to avoid inflating the economy on a fragile bubble. It may have been slow but the Obama Recovery is incredibly stable (did you even know the rest of the world s economy is a mess?) and so far resistant to shocks. If we keep up this pace, Obama will be handing his (Democratic) successor a solid foundation from which to build a bridge to the future.Maybe they can find jobs for all the Republicans that will be out of work come election day?Featured image via Black Water Dog/Pete Souza",News,"January 8, 2016"
 ‘Pissed As Hell’ Oregon Rancher FURIOUS At Bundy Militia: ‘This Is My Home!’ (VIDEO),"Georgia Marshall has had just about enough of the white privilege performance art masquerading as a patriotic revolt against the tyranny of something something EVIL GUB MINT! Ever since the Bundy terrorists seized a wildlife refuge in Harney County, the entire county has been seriously pissed off at the presumption of these idiots that they speak for the residents. Unlike the Bundy cosplayers, the residents of Harney are grown ups who have worked very hard to build a working relationship with their government: The progress we ve made in this community compared with the sh*t we went through years ago when you could not stand in talk to a manager,  she told the crowd.  Granted, it s not a lot of progress but it s coming. Marshall pointed out that an organization called the High Desert Partnership was already working  damn hard  for the residents of Harney County. We are the poster child of the ranching community, of the environmental community, of the government community!  she exclaimed.  Have we ever had anybody put together a refuge plan in this god damn nation? Hell, no, we haven t! But it happened here and it happened in Harney County. This is how grownups behave. If you don t like how the local government works, you push and you compromise and you talk and you keep pushing until things start to get better. On the other hand, when you re an entitled, self-important little shit like Ammon Bundy, you pull out your gun, holler about  freedumb!  and demand your every whim be catered to. Especially getting snacks.Here s the awesome video of Georgia taking the Bundy morons behind the woodshed for a shellacking:Now, if it seems odd that a group of anti-government jackasses would show up in Oregon and make demands for a community they don t belong to, you re not crazy. When the Bundy boys originally rolled into town, they were all about the Hammond family not serving the full sentence for their crimes. But, the Hammonds said  Holy crap! These yahoos aren t with us! Please let us serve our time in peace  and the Bundy boneheads suddenly found themselves without a cause. So, as wealthy entitled white people, they defaulted to  Waaaaahhhh! The government is oppressing us!  and demanded they be given more free stuff because in right-wing  Murika, rich white people get everything and screw everyone else.I hope Georgia and the other residents of Harney get their wish for a Bundy-free county so they can live their lives the way they want, not the way a group of wannabe martyrs and cheap knockoff revolutionaries say they should.Featured image via screencap.",News,"January 8, 2016"
 President Obama To Critics Of His Tearful Address On Gun Violence: I Give Precisely Zero F*cks (VIDEO),"President Obama held a CNN televised Town Hall Meeting on Guns in America on Thursday night, during which he took a moment to remind those criticizing him for showing emotion that he gives precisely zero f*cks about their opinions. He is focused entirely on saving lives, and bringing the plague of gun violence under control.CNN host Anderson Cooper first replayed the President s emotional address for the audience. This is captured in the video below. Obama doesn t work up some watery eyes. He has tears literally running down his cheeks as he recounts the 26 people gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school, 20 of them first-graders, and the devastation of the loved ones left to grieve the loss. His growing frustration at the intransigence of conservative lawmakers to give so much as an inch in the face of such catastrophic and preventable tragedies has been clear in each new post-shooting statement he has had to deliver to the nation.However, conservatives have concocted all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories about what those tears really meant. One Fox host even went so far as to argue Obama was using a raw onion to produce the tears.So, when asked about the reaction, Obama took a moment to revisit his encounter with the parents of the children slain at Newtown. What becomes clear is that any human being with a functional level of empathy should be breaking down in tears in the face of such horror. I visited Newtown two days after what happened. So, it was still very raw. It s the only time I ve ever seen Secret Service cry, on duty.It wasn t just the parents. You had siblings, you know? 10-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 3-year-olds, who in some cases didn t even understand that their brother or sister wasn t going to be coming home.And I ve said this before. It continues to haunt me. It was one of the worst days of my Presidency. To those who argued he was crying about the wrong thing, the President had a straightforward reply: I want to emphasize that there are a lot of tragedies that happen out there as a consequence to the victims of crime, you know, there are police officers who are out there laying down their lives to protect us every single day, you know, and tears are appropriate for them, as well. And I visit with those families, as well, victims of terrorism. Soldiers coming home. You know, there s a lot of heartache out there and I don t suggest that this is the only kind of heartache we should be working on. You know, I ve spent a lot of time and a lot of hours, in fact, a lot more hours than I spend on this, trying to prevent terrorist attacks. It s a tough job, being the President of the United States. A role where decisions that are literally life and death have to be made every day of the week. America, and the world, need someone in the White House with the humanity to make those decisions with care and consideration. That s something to remember come November 2016.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Donald Trump Reveals The First Thing He’d Do If America Puts Him In The White House (IMAGES),"Republican front runner Donald Trump has revealed a truly insidious  First Day in the White House.  His number 1 priority? Removing  Gun-Free Zones  from schools.To much of the world, schools being gun-free is standard. The entire developed world has achieved consensus on the simple logic that deadly weapons and children don t mix. It seems only the Republican Party of the United States and their followers reject this logic. As a result, the U.S. leads the developed world in deaths by gun per capita and school shootings, by a distance which is as horrifying as it is embarrassing.As we can see from the data compiled by Quartz, the United States suffered almost the same number of mass killings in schools between 2000 and 2010 than 36 other nations combined. This figure becomes yet more astonishing when they point out the fact that:In 2010, the US was home to a population of approximately 309 million. The populations of these other countries totaled 3.8 billion.Yet, speaking to an audience in Burlington, Vermont on Thursday night  Trump announced: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools  you have to   and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day, You know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko?  he asked.  That s bait. Trump timed the announcement to coincide with the President s Town Hall meeting on gun violence, which was airing on CNN. President Obama, having been consistently thwarted in his efforts at bipartisan cooperation on gun control, will now use executive powers to implement a raft of measures to protect American citizens from out-of-control gun violence.Donald Trump and the Republican Party just failed a very big test. Given the choice to operate with political courage in the interests of the American people, or with political opportunism in the interests of themselves and their donors, Trump and the GOP picked the latter. In doing so, they put American lives in peril, and proved themselves unworthy of a place in the White House.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Donald Trump Tells Security To Throw Bernie Sanders Supporter Out Into The Cold Without His Coats (VIDEO),"It seems Donald Trump s cruelty knows no bounds, especially after his latest campaign rally.During a rally in the middle of a very cold winter night in Vermont, Trump ordered security to throw a Bernie Sanders supporter out of the building without his coat.Several Sanders supporters gained entrance into the Burlington rally at the Flynn Center throughout the evening in order to heckle and interrupt the Republican presidential wannabe.Of course, the Sanders fans managed to annoy Trump to the point where his campaign team actually began to screen people to make sure they were Trump fans. Considering how Trump has treated protesters and hecklers during previous rallies, it was only a matter of time before he treated them heartlessly.At one point in particular, Trump directed attention toward one man and ordered security to escort him out. This normally would not be unusual since hecklers and protesters are escorted out of rallies all the time, but in this instance, Trump noted the extremely cold temperature outside and told security to throw the man out into the freezing air without his coat. I thought I heard a little voice over there. Get him outta there! Don t give him his coat. Keep his coat. Confiscate his coat. You know it s about ten degrees below zero outside. No, you can keep his coat. Tell him we ll send it to him in a couple of weeks. And Trump s supporters cheered the cruelty as the man was parted from his coat and forced to go without it during a freezing night in Vermont.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump went on to acknowledge that he expected some Sanders supporters to interrupt his rally since he was in Vermont, Sanders  home state.Sanders and Trump have engaged each other recently through media and social media, the most notable of which occurred when Sanders criticized Trump for not supporting wage increases for workers during an interview on CBS. The very next day, Trump flip-flopped on the minimum wage, posting on Twitter that it s bad that workers haven t received much of a raise in years.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Seth Meyers Dubs Oregon Militia Terrorist #Tarpman In Most Hilarious Mockery Yet (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day. Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort. Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  Tarpman,  and proceed to mock him relentlessly. Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave. Then, it panned to  Tarpman  hiding with his gun. After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity. He even called  Tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia Clue.

" So, About That ‘Stand Down’ Order In Benghazi From Hillary– IT NEVER HAPPENED (VIDEO)","That dreadful night in Benghazi, Libya in September of 2012 when the lives of four Americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget. We shall never forget it for two reasons: because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life, and because Republicans and Fox News insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in her reaction to events that took place.Clarifying one of the longest held myths by Fox News and conservatives, Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta spoke to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell. Not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove Hillary as uncaring and incompetent, but he also explained how everything that could have been done, was done.Mitchell first asks Panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in Benghazi:Now you re here in Washington because you re going to be testifying to the Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. You have already testified to other committees, but to this committee, and there s a new movie coming out, 13 Hours, and it s about to be released. It is accusing the CIA operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time. And the suggestion is that, if not for that order to stand down, that Chris Stevens and the others might have been saved. First of all, you were at the Pentagon at the time, I believe. Was there any order to stand down that you know of?Panetta responds:Absolutely not. You know, I m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented, but from my experience, and from the role that I played as secretary of defense, there was never any order to stand down. On the contrary, the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives.Delving further into if there were any sort of Hillary Clinton misstep, Mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order:There s also a report, several reports, that the Pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort, military effort to the State Department, and that someone, the suggestion is Hillary Clinton, said,  no thanks, we don t need the help or stand down or stand back.  Was there any effort by the Pentagon to intervene that the State Department rejected and would she have even been in the role?Panetta offers an answer that many right-wingers are not going to like whatsoever, the truth:I m not aware of any such effort at all. As a matter of fact, after meeting with the president, I immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces, to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved, and we in fact put forces in place. The problem was that [the] attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there. This is a tragic event. It s tragic in a number of ways. But most importantly, it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately, I think, doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives.Panetta is exactly right. This tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against Hillary Clinton. We need to learn from what happened in Benghazi and make sure it never happens again. We also need to, once and for all, put the myth to bed that Hillary was incompetent. She, of all people, is quite aware of the loss that happened that day. She s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again. Video/Featured image: MMFA",News,"January 8, 2016"
 Numbskull Ben Carson Just Managed To P*ss Off Every Decent Parent In America,"Ben Carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery. He has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue,s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the  pants on fire  category of fact checkers on numerous occasions.His stories about growing up some street-wary tough guy who liked to beat and stab people turned out to be fabrications. His tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone. The only thing Carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class. He likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon.Whatever it was that pushed Ben Carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly. Left unscripted and with a microphone, Carson is his own worst enemy. That was never more obvious than it was at a recent campaign stop to talk to 5th-graders in Des Moines at the Isaac Newton Christian school.Apparently Carson was again trying to build on that old favorite  dumb kid  card when he turned into by far the dumbest person in the room. Without considering that he was dealing with 10-year-olds, Carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them. A Des Moines Register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student:W/ crowd of 500 @RealBenCarson just called out to 5th grade class: who's dumbest kid in class? At least half dozen kids point to 1 student.  Timothy Meinch (@timeinch) January 7, 2016If you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you, you should have your idiot filter cleaned. In what universe is it OK to EVER degrade a child to make a political statement? The student said he wasn t upset by being singled out, which may make Carson feel better, but certainly not the kid s parents.Carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end.

They hold themselves to a  higher moral standard.  They think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than Democrats. All of those things, however, are underscored by the one thing that defines Republicans more than anything else: Hypocrisy.The GOP-controlled Missouri state legislature is considering a bill from Rep Bart Korman that would require the  gift  of sex with a lobbyist to be disclosed, but not with a monetary value. Take your time and read it again; your eyes aren t deceiving you. The actual wording of the bill states: the term  gift  shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of the general assembly or his or her staff. Relations between married persons or between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the lobbyist, the election of the member to the general assembly, or the employment of the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision. The reporting of sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation. So .yeah. If you re married to a lobbyist or are in an actual relationship with a lobbyist you re good, but if you re boinking one for political gain you have to report it without attaching a dollar value. That little stipulation would presumably keep parties involved from being charged with solicitation.There is some speculation that the bill has its origins in a political quagmire of corruption that Korman himself is at the center of. According to our friends at Freak Out Nation:What we have here is a classic kindergarten game of  if I can t have it, neither can you  that dates back to a kerfuffle related to a fancypants dinner  meeting  held in January 2015.  The House Telecommunications Committee, which is led by none other than Rep. Korman, held a  meeting  at the Jefferson City Country Club, where the men dined on fancy steaks and other high priced entrees.  Oh, and this dinner was fully paid for by a lobbying group that the Committee oversees.The press got wind of it and the public was so incensed that Speaker John Diehl ordered all future meetings be held at the Capital. Rep. Korman tried to justify the Committee s actions by saying that meeting at the club for dinner was the only time the group could congregate.So here we are, one year later, and Rep. Korman proposes this quite bizarre Bill that requires sex be listed as a  gift.  What does that mean, though? Is he insinuating that lobbyists are engaging in sexual activity with lawmakers on a regular basis? Is this directed specifically at Speaker Diehl or another member of the House? So many questions and no answers yet.Political shenanigans need to be called out on this one for sure, but alas Missouri is Missouri. Republicans in red states seldom feel the need to explain themselves. Should the public become concerned with issues they don t want to deal with they can simply introduce a bill limiting abortion, taking food stamps from children or removing any and all gun restrictions on the books.Shiny object politics at its finest.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"January 7, 2016"
 WATCH: Obama Goes BEAST MODE On CNN Anchor For Pushing Gun Grab Conspiracy (VIDEO),"President Obama got real and raw with CNN s Anderson Cooper during a televised town hall meeting on gun violence..@POTUS addresses the ""conspiracy"" that ""we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns"" https://t.co/AFzFmmsvGC https://t.co/p611SWIrgk  CNN (@CNN) January 8, 2016Obama was speaking about the right-wing conspiracy that he is in favor of mass confiscation of guns when Cooper interrupted him and asked,  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? A lot of people believe this deeply. That stopped the President in his tracks, and he angrily turned to the anchor. I m sorry Cooper, yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that. For years President Obama has had to keep his emotion in check, knowing that flashes of anger and outbursts would instantly give his political opponents fodder for tired, old lines of attack about the  angry black man. But Cooper s indulgence of the right wing myth of gun confiscation came at the wrong time in Obama s presidency. He has a year left in office, with no more elections left to fight without the need to soothe the egos of those spinning wild yarns without any connection to reality.While Anderson Cooper isn t a right-winger like the figures littering the airwaves on Fox News, his invocation of a  both sides  talking point was almost as bad. Obama s actual actions and proposals on guns bear no resemblance to the right s ongoing characterization of them as a  gun grab,  and even less so the idea that Obama supports  gun confiscation. The people promoting that idea   the NRA, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and other figures on the right are simply pushing a conspiracy theory on par with the idea that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job or that the government is covering up alien abductions. It is patently absurd for Cooper to give credence to this wild-eyed assertions, and Obama understandably was put off by Cooper giving it credibility on-air.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Paul Ryan Attacks President Obama For Being ‘Distracted’ By Murdered Children,"On Monday, President Obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws. Republicans, predictably, went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional.  In the world of the GOP gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever, EVER try to make this country a safer place because .FREEDOM!One day after announcing his executive action on gun laws, President Obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and when Obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation. Callous Republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was one of those people.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke to Yahoo News s Katie Couric, on Thursday, where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on Tuesday. The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us. The United States has become a war zone and the weapons of choice are as easy to buy as toilet paper. How scary is that? Murica!Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Maine’s Tea Party Governor Just Went On A Racist Rant So Offensive It Could Get Him Impeached,"Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage (R-Of Course) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office, but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting, Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of LePage s mouth   and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem, LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting (white) Mainers hooked on heroin. It got worse from there. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty   these types of guys   they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,  LePage told a large crowd.  Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist, LePage s long-suffering communication director, Peter Steele, said that this wasn t about race. He then gave the following word salad defense. The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. There are, might I say, just a few questions left unanswered here. Why did he use names like  D-Money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from Connecticut and New York? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer? Why did he specifically mention  young, white girls  when describing the kind of girls D-Money  likes to  impregnate?  Does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women?But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women?Democrats have long complained about LePage, but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior. Some have even created a website called  Get Right Maine,  which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage, his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically. Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters, Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said LePage created this situation with his own actions. We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration,  said McCabe.  Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us. We are committed to addressing the drug crisis, growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills.   The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games. He just handed his haters   which is, roughly, just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition. Ever his own worst enemy, LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum, accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office, the better.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016"
" Dem Presidential Candidate Asks: What If Right-Wing Domestic Terrorists Were Black, Muslim?","Democratic presidential Martin O Malley just got real about the response to the right-wing domestic terrorists who are occupying federal land in Oregon.Speaking to an Iowa radio station, O Malley, the former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, was blunt about the ongoing situation. This is not the way we act as Americans and I dare say that the federal government s exercising a lot of restraint here,  said O Malley.  It s hard to fathom or it s hard to imagine if the people taking over buildings by armed force were Muslim or black, as some commentators have said, it would be the same reaction. So hopefully this will get resolved peacefully. They are not militia, they re acting in criminal ways, this is criminal behavior. Since the militia members   led by the son of rogue rancher Cliven Bundy   illegally took over the federal facility, the mainstream media has fumbled over what precisely to call the men. First they were called  peaceful protesters, and  then they were called  armed protesters  in dispatches from ABC News and the Associated Press.Even after one of the men, who are white, made a public statement that he would be willing to die while occupying the government land, the bulk of the mainstream media has been unwilling to apply the label of  terrorism  to their activities.The kid gloves treatment being afforded to the gang   recently federal law enforcement said they could come and go as they please   has led people to compare the treatment to situations like 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Rice, who was black, had the police called on him while he played with a toy gun. Instead of being  talked down  and negotiated with, he was shot and killed in the street and led by the prosecutor a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who did the deed.In addition to the disparity in treatment, Republican presidential candidates have condemned the specific gun-wielding tactics of the occupiers while also heaping praise on the  principles  behind their gripes, which are complaints about the federal government collecting money for the use of land owned by the government.These men and other militia affiliated groups have tried to argue that the government cannot own the land in question, and that they should be allowed to raise profit-making livestock on it without paying anyone.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Warnings Issued After NRA Fans Plan To Open Carry Guns Near President Obama,"Once again pro-gun forces in America are trying to intimidate anyone trying to reduce gun violence   even the President himself.Ahead of President Obama s town hall about his executive action to reduce gun violence, warnings were issued about the likelihood of gun fans parading around outside the event brandishing their weapons.President Obama s town hall event on gun violence at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. on Thursday night is likely to provoke strong emotions. And the school s police chief is warning students and faculty that protesters could be carrying weapons on campus   legally. Please be advised that it is lawful to carry firearms in Virginia, and this includes at public outdoor spaces on our campus,  Thomas Longo, GMU s interim chief of police said in an email to the school s internal listserv. Though students are on winter break, the chief wrote that the University Police  will have officers present to ensure that all protesters remain law-abiding. Over the last few years the so-called  open carry  movement has paraded around with weapons in public as a way for gun extremists to show off to everyone how supposedly macho they are.In some cases, these protesters have taken their weapons into restaurants, supermarkets, and major chain stores like Target. Understandably, most parents don t want to have guns swinging around while they re trying to buy their weekly groceries and some stores have begun to ban the open carry crowd.The NRA   who chickened out when CNN invited them to this town hall   has pushed the president as the gun confiscator-in-chief, when in reality at best Obama has pushed for expanded background checks and limits on gun magazines. Now those who have been teed off by this organization   who pays its executives handsomely from their annual dues   have been driven to brandish guns outside an event under heavy secret service protection.It isn t smart, it s dangerous, and at best it will continue to make the pro-gun side of the debate come across as unhinged extremists.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 7, 2016"
" Donald Trump Claims Paris Is In Germany, But We Assure You It Is Not","If you ve attended a basic geography class, you probably know that France and Germany are separate countries. You probably also know that Paris is the capital of France. But if you re Donald Trump, the man with the  world s greatest memory, you might be a bit confused on that point. See, not only can Trump remember thousands of Muslims cheering 9/11 in New Jersey (a feat even major news networks can not accomplish), but he knows that Paris is in Germany. Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level,  Trump tweeted Thursday.  Germany is a total mess-big crime.  Ironically, he ended the tweet with  GET SMART! Now, since Trump said it, it s likely that conservatives will believe it until they see with their own eyes that it isn t true   so we re going to do a public service and help them out.Now, it might seem scary with all the pictures and colors, but it shows the entire world. No, stop trying to eat it. Don t make me get the water bottle!OK, now that that s sorted out, this map has a thing on it called  words.  Words are those funny little combinations of letters people who don t grunt to communicate throw together to let people know what they want to say. Now, if you look at a place called Europe, you ll notice that France and Germany are right next to one another.Yes, Donald, France and Germany are right next to one another. In fact, one of them (France, where Paris is located) recently played host to a terrorist attack that Republicans often use to justify their horrific calls to round Muslims up into camps and prevent them from entering the United States (sound familiar, Donald?).

 Local Citizens To Bundy Terrorists: ‘Get The H*ll Out!’ (VIDEO),"Harney County resident Jarvis Kennedy has a message for the out-of-state terrorists who have taken over Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Get the hell out of here. Mr. Kennedy, who is a Burns Paiute Tribal Councilman, spoke at a meeting of the council on Wednesday, saying the armed militants occupying the wildlife refuge are unwelcome and unwanted. His comments were met with a round of thundering applause from those in attendance. We as Harney County citizens don t need some clown to come in here and stand up for us,  Kennedy said.  They just need to get the hell out of here. Councilman Kennedy began his remarks by comparing the government s treatment of  Natives  to those of the terrorist organization occupying Malheur. I got a question for the world,  he said.  What if it was a bunch of Natives that went out there and overtook that   or any federal land? What would the outcome be? Think about that. What would happen? Would they let us come into town and get supplies and re-up? For those unfamiliar with the history, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was settled by the Paiute and other Native American tribes some 11,000 years before it was declared a  sanctuary  for native bird species by president Theodore Roosevelt, in 1908.Mr. Kennedy s ancestors were removed from the land by the federal government.The hypocrisy of those who support the YallQaeda terrorists knows no bounds. These are people who deny that the federal government has  authority  to remove people from their land. Clearly, if that is the case, the land belongs to the local tribes that had lived there for thousands of years before the federal government removed them, not ignorant militiamen from Nevada, Florida, Arizona or any other state of the non-Oregon variety. We don t need them to back us up,  Councilman Kennedy told the crowd.  We didn t ask them here. We don t want them here. Mr. Kennedy made it clear that, in spite of right wing propaganda to the contrary, the armed men occupying the wildlife refuge are terrorists. They say they don t want to bother the community,  he said angrily.  But you know what? Our little kids are sitting at home right now, when they should be at school. They re jeopardizing and they re scaring everyone. Watch Councilman Kennedy s speech published by KGW in Portland via YouTube: Local tribal members are not the only Harney County residents enraged over the out-of-state terrorist occupation of Malheur.A long list of organizations have denounced the Bundy terrorists, including groups that represent Harney County farmers and ranchers, such as the Oregon Cattleman s Association and the Rural Organizing Project.The group Oregon Wild sternly denounced the Bundy s and their supporters as domestic terrorists, holding a community hostage for their own political gain. The dictionary definition of the word terrorism is  the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.  This word should not be used lightly, but it is exactly what the extremist group currently occupying Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is attempting to do,  said Oregon Wild Executive Director Sean Stevens.Even the Hammonds, the two men these terrorists are supposed to be defending, have made it clear that they do not agree with or support the actions of the men who are terrorizing Harney County.As Portland, Oregon s KGW reports here, Groups representing businesses, wildlife and residents in Harney County have released statements about the protest. None supported the armed occupation at the wildlife refuge. The men holed up in Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have deluded themselves into believing that they are heroes, fighting for people  not strong enough  to fight for themselves.Harney county residents make it clear that these armed lunatics are living in a fantasy world. They neither want or need  help  from the delusional nut jobs that have descended on their community. The citizens see these men for exactly what they are, domestic terrorists attempting to exploit the Hammonds conviction for poaching and arson, in order to further their own political agenda.As Harney County Sheriff David Ward points out here, the Bundys and their followers are not there to  help  anyone but themselves and their anti-government agenda. These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to over throw the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. Instead of defending the local citizens, as the Bundy terrorists claim they re doing, they are terrorizing a small community that never asked them to come and very clearly wants them to leave.Featured image via screencapture",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Mike Huckabee Throws Evangelicals Under A Speeding Bus For Not Supporting His Campaign (AUDIO),"Mike Huckabee is fed up with evangelical  Christians  and threw a temper tantrum because they won t support his run for president.The Republican presidential wannabe aired his grievances with conservative  Christians  during an interview with Fox host Todd Starnes, throwing them under the bus in the process.Huckabee s poll numbers stand at a meager 1.3 percent, which makes him particularly angry at evangelicals as they flock to Ted Cruz. This, of course, sent the former preacher into a jealous rage as he accused evangelicals of caring more about getting rich off social issues than changing the law. A lot of them, quite frankly, I think they re scared to death that if a guy like me got elected, I would actually do what I said I would do, and that is I would focus on the personhood of every individual, we would abolish abortion based on the Fifth and 14th Amendment, we would ignore the Supreme Court s same-sex marriage decision. As we all know, Huckabee has repeatedly said he intends to ignore the Supreme Court and abolish a woman s right to choose and same-sex marriage should he become president. But he says evangelicals are not really into doing either of those things because it would bring their money-making operation to an end. A lot of these organizations wouldn t have the ability to do urgent fundraising because if we slay the dragon, what dragon do they continue to fight? And so, for many of them, it could be a real detriment to their organization s abilities to gin up their supporters and raise the contributions, and I know that sounds cynical but, Todd, it is what it is. Huckabee then accused conservative  Christians  of running on  secular standards  instead of on biblical principles and told Starnes that these organizations should come out and admit to donors that they really don t believe in biblical principles, they just want to dupe Christians into making them rich. Look, we re a club, we re an organization,  Huckabee suggested they say.  We talk about prayer, but we don t necessarily believe that it will change things. There comes a time in our lives where we either believe in a great God who does great things and uses sometimes the weak to get it done, or else we don t believe in that and we just get human might and we gather all the human resources and we live or die by the human sword. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.This little hissy fit by Huckabee is incredibly revealing. Not only did Huckabee decimate any chance he had of getting their support, he basically blew the whistle on how these conservative  Christian  organizations operate and what they actually believe. Huckabee just came out and blasted these organizations of fleecing donors for money by pretending to believe in God and prayer and not really caring about enacting a social conservative agenda because they wouldn t be able to make any more money once it goes into effect.This might actually be the first time Huckabee has been truthful throughout his entire political career, and you can bet that conservatives are going to blow a gasket over it.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Watch Trump Fans Attack Peaceful Protesters Holding ‘America’s Already Great’ Sign (VIDEO),"Two completely peaceful protesters were attacked and forcefully escorted from a Donald Trump rally on Monday after loyal supporters realized their signs were pro-Obama and anti-Trump.The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts was packed, and the footage captured shows two men wearing glasses sitting amongst the supporters. The men aren t doing anything to attract attention to themselves other than holding bright yellow signs, one that reads  America is already great  and another that says  God bless President Obama.  Eventually, Trump s fans find out that they re on the opposite side of the voting spectrum.Upon this discovery, a few of Trump s loyal and aggressive minions attempt to start a verbal altercation with the protesters. One man behind the protesters is seen telling them,  Shut your mouth!  while a man in front of them motions to the signs and says, You re at a Trump rally? Ditch those! Ditch  em! When that didn t have the desired effect, the Trump lovers took it a step further. The supporters grabbed the signs out of the non-confrontational protesters  hands and ripped them to pieces as many other nearby supporters began to scream and chant Trump s name. It wasn t long before security surrounded the two men and escorted them out of the rally.

" Trump Campaign Chairman Goes Rogue, Is Caught Joining YallQaeda","It appears that the Bundy militia has finally managed to radicalize a highly impressionable American into joining their cause   and it just so happens to be one of Donald Trump s campaign officials.In a shining example of the kind of people who gravitate towards the Republican front-runners campaign, Jerry DeLemus, an anti-government fanatic, dropped what he was doing as the co-chairman of  Veterans for Trump  in New Hampshire to join up with the Bundy family members in Oregon to attempt to kickstart a revolution to overthrow the federal government.According to his Facebook, DeLemus (who is married to a New Hampshire Republican state congresswoman) arrived in Burns, Oregon along with a  videographer  to wage a  psyops war  on the mainstream media that are spreading  lies  about the Bundy brothers. screengrab via Raw StoryDeLemus is no stranger to walking right up to the line of insurrection. He has been adamant that the government is ruled by tyranny and may need to be overthrown. The Bundy brothers are just the kind of fanatics that he would latch on to. As the Daily Beast recently reported, DeLemus spent much of 2013 trying to raise an right-wing army in Rochester. He s begging for a fight. I believe that we have another financial collapse coming soon and it will be worse than the one in 2008,  Delemus warned.  There are stark differences we must realize that we have nearly a 0% interest rate and our debt is nearly double. Not to mention our credit rating has been dropped. On top of this we have a government that has no respect or regard for the rule of law as provided in our Constitution.If we do not stand against this insanity we can be sure we will fully slip into tyranny. We are in a similar position our Founding Fathers found themselves in and their decision to stand was equally difficult. During the 2014 standoff at Bundy Ranch in Nevada, he was right there with the other  patriots,  marching with guns and facing off against the federal government.Apparently, nobody let him know that Trump was not on the same page. Trump may be a racist, xenophobic narcissist, but he s not  let s overthrow the government  crazy. At the same time DeLemus was grabbing his camping gear and buying a plane ticket to Oregon, Trump was disavowing the militia. Trump, like many of his Republican challengers, felt the militia was too extreme, even for conservatives.When asked his feelings on the group, he called them lawless.  You have to maintain law and order, no matter what. It s a bit awkward that one of his staffers is now joining their ranks.So why would a guy like DeLemus support  law and order  Trump? That s easy. They share an affinity for hating Muslims.Inspired by the bigotry in Texas, DeLemus recently tried to organize a  Draw Muhammad  rally in New Hampshire in the hopes of inciting violence between right-wing bigots and Muslim residents. The event fell apart and DeLemus claimed he  won  against Muslims anyway by  spreading awareness. If DeLemus s rush to join an anti-government militia illegally occupying a wildlife refuge shows us anything, it s that Trump s base is teeming with right-wing extremists held together by little more than hatred. It s hard to imagine a single other candidate losing a campaign staffer to an insurrection and maintaining his or her massive lead in the polls, but Trump doesn t rely on anything but his own big mouth to keep himself in the lead.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 7, 2016"
" Ted Cruz Reveals Paranoid Fantasy Involving Obama, A Chisel, And Arlington Cemetery (TWEETS)","Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz stunned audiences on the campaign trail this week with a piece of paranoid fantasy that would make Alex Jones blush. On Wednesday, Cruz reportedly told crowds:Cruz: ""We're just steps away from the chisels at Arlington coming out to remove crosses and stars of David from tombstones.""  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016For most rational human beings, this statement would occur as a flight of fear-mongering fancy so far beyond the bounds of reality that it was laughable. But, he is appealing to Republican voters after all   a majority of whom believe the Earth was created 5000 years ago, by an omnipotent God.But even for a GOP candidate, this is out there. So, what on earth prompted this moment of insanity?Context of that Cruz nightmare of crosses being chiseled off soldiers' tombstones: It could happen if 5 liberals dominate SCOTUS  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016Seriously, that s it. Apparently Senator Cruz believes that the only thing restraining Obama from sneaking into Arlington with a chisel and removing religious symbols from the gravestones, is the presence of conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States.Could it be that the GOP hopeful s rant had less to do with Arlington, and more to do with the fact that the birther conspiracy has blown up in his face?Cruz, born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, is now facing the Birther conspiracy that he so enjoyed inflicting upon President Obama. The three requirements to be President of the United States are:The definition of  Natural Born Citizen  is still unsettled in U.S. law, meaning that Cruz is far more open to genuine challenge by the Birther movement than Hawaii native Barack Obama.This sounds like the desperate rant of a candidate in trouble. As Driftglass points out expertly:Ted Cruz knows the rotting, raving heart of the GOP perfectly well. From his dentist s drill voice to the transparently concocted, treacly fascism of his style, he has spent his adult life meticulously constructing a public persona to fit the madness of his party hand-in-glove.And he is not going to let some interloping radioactive Chia-publican sweep in and steal his brownshirt chumps.Awkward.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Cher Does NOT Hold Back On Twitter As She Calls For Death Of Michigan Governor (TWEETS),"When it comes to the safety of our drinking water that comes out of our taps, we are left to trust those who are elected to keep us safe and work in our best interests. However, what s been happening in Flint, Michigan over the past few years is criminal. Flint s city manager was held accountable to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) alone. They, alongside other officials denied that there was lead contamination in the Flint s water.As Rachel Maddow reported: For more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored irrefutable evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River exposed [residents] to extreme toxicity,  the complaint reads.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River water was as deadly as it was arrogant. Calling officials  conduct  so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience,  the complaint cites the specific experiences of a few plaintiffs and their families, all of whom allege they have been challenged by similar health ailments since high levels of lead and copper entered their bloodstreams.These conditions include skin lesions, hair loss, chemical-induced hypertension, vision loss and depression. Of the four families described in the complaint, two had ceased to drink Flint water after a certain point   and used it only for washing and cooking   but still said they were exposed to many of the same ill effects. Finally admitting to the toxicity in Flint, Snyder declared a state of emergency and apologized, but for many it is too late. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened an investigation into how things could have gone so devastatingly wrong for so long. This is following an EPA investigation that began last November.Needless to say, people are utterly outraged, and justifiably so.Taking to Twitter, legendary artist Cher called Snyder out by name and asked that he be jailed. Then going a step further, called for the death penalty. She said: Gov. of Michigan is a murderer. HE made the decision to give people poison water, and now must sign disaster bill. Children will  never  recover. #jailforRick WTF is going on with power. Mad, greed driven, killer. Incompetent politicians? They are criminals! Gov.

People are upset, and have every right to be outraged. Citizens were poisoned. CHILDREN were poisoned, and people need to be held accountable. It will be interesting to see if Snyder himself will resign and face trial. This criminal behavior needs to be accounted for.Featured image: YouTube/Flickr/Twitter",News,"January 7, 2016"
 The Daily Show Puts Vile Fox Host In Her Place For Accusing President Obama Of Faking Tears (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah has been criticized for not taking on Fox News as much as Jon Stewart used to do, but on Wednesday, the new Daily Show host proved he can be just as tough on them.On Tuesday, President Obama delivered a speech announcing new executive actions to combat the epidemic of gun violence in this country. As he referenced the 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook, Obama could no longer hold in his emotions and began to shed tears. Clearly, the deaths of these children and all the children who have been killed by guns affects him deeply.But the heartless hosts of Fox News quickly accused President Obama of faking crying. Andrea Tantaros of Outnumbered stirred much outrage after suggesting that Obama kept an onion in the podium. I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears,  Tantaros said in agreement with her colleagues.  It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. Trevor Noah, on the other hand, had a completely different reaction. He praised President Obama and declared that it is about time that something was finally done to combat gun violence. Noah even appreciated President Obama s raw emotion. See that thing you re feeling right now, that pain in your chest that comes from watching someone weep on national television, because he knows that society can do better than to file the shooting of children under  shit happens?  That feeling is how you know that you re human. No matter how opposed to Obama s policies people may be or how cynical their politics they have to at least acknowledge and respect the raw authenticity of that emotion. Or so you would think. After playing a clip of Tantaros accusing Obama of crying fake tears, Noah expressed his disgust and lamented that she shares the title of human being with everyone else. Are you fucking kidding me?! Shedding tears when you think of murdered children is not really believable? You know what? There is something here that is not really believable, the fact that the rest of us have to share the title of human being with you. Here s the video via Comedy Central.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveAndrea Tantaros is a vile sorry excuse for a human being for accusing President Obama of pretending to cry over children whose lives were cut unfairly short by guns. It is absolutely heartless for anyone to think such a thing, and Tantaros should be ashamed of herself.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 7, 2016"
" Native American Tribal Leader Shuts Down Oregon’s Cry-Baby White Militia, And It’s Glorious (IMAGE/VIDEO)","It has been almost a week since over 20 armed gunmen occupied a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, demanding the land be returned to its  rightful owners . The Chair of the areas Native American tribe had something to say about that, and it s a mic drop.When chair of Burns Paiute tribe heard protestors would return land to its rightful owners, she joked she started writing acceptance letter  Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) January 6, 2016One of the armed gunmen, Ryan Payne, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday, claiming that: the federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States,  and people who use and love the land   ranchers, miners, and loggers, among others   deserve to have it back.The 5.2 million Native American and Alaska Native s identified by the 2010 U.S. Census might be a little more familiar with this problem that the ammosexual occupiers of the Oregon reserve.An interactive map put together by the science and humanities magazine Aeon shows details the land grab of 1776 to 1887, during which the United States seized over 1.5 billion acres from America s indigenous people by treaty and executive order.The short video below shows the near total transfer of land from Native American tribes to the United States over that time frame.  On Wednesday of this week, the Burns Paiute Tribe, who s reservation is close to the armed occupation, called on the militia-men to leave. The Chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Tribe, Charlotte Rodrique, told Reuters that the occupation was  desecrating one of our sacred sites, I don t give much credence to their cause, she continued. We never gave up our aboriginal rights to the territory, so we as a tribe actually view this as our land, no matter who is living on it,  she said.  We were here first and just want to set the facts straight. Her dignified message somewhat underscores the wanton belligerence of the Bundy militia, who the FBI confirm will face federal charges when their standoff comes to an end.

In a new ad, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says that President Barack Obama spies on Israel.

Why would Marco Rubio spend millions of dollars on an ad to mention a foreign country thousands of miles away?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMMwWXWCCn8]The answer lies in the money Rubio stands to receive from pro-Israel lobby groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an organization that can make or break a political campaign with its enormous organization and wealth.

 NRA ‘Good Guy With a Gun’ Angry About Obama’s Executive Orders Shoots Up Apartment Building (VIDEO),"Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the  gun show loophole  and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them   like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns, conservatives have been preparing for  war on the President s policies. We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab   that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something, something Dark Side. And, of course, as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric, one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police in Redding, California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building. According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department, what law enforcement found was sort of expected. A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws. If that s not bad enough, he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window. Once police arrived, he began shooting at them: Officers made verbal contact with the subject, described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system. The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers.  Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama. The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up. During this time, officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance.  An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful. After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender, the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand, leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment, in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees,  the release notes.  Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times.  The suspect was declared deceased on scene. We heard the five shots   everyone was screaming,  resident David Rice recalled.  He came out screaming  Obama! Obama! Obama!  (Police) told him to come out with (his) hands up, and he kept telling them  No, no, no. One woman recounted being briefly taken hostage by the anti-Obama shooter, who grabbed her and pulled her into his apartment: As soon as he shut the door, he hugged me and he kissed me on the forehead. He was aiming at a guy, and then he just got sloppy   he was shooting everywhere. The shooter, whose name has not been released, had a documented history of mental issues and was a felon, but was somehow able to get a gun   in other words, he was exactly the sort of person the President s plan aims to keep from being weapons.Fortunately, no one was hurt (aside from the shooter) this time.Watch a video of the shooter below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));EXCLUSIVE: Cell phone video captures exactly what happened at a deadly officer involved shooting Tuesday night in Posted by Madison Wade on Wednesday, January 6, 2016You can also view a report on the shooting here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0-aOi2nkHk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 7, 2016"
 ‘This Is A Nightmare’: AL City’s Black Residents Live In Fear Under ‘Confederate Commander’ Police Chief,"The black residents of Dothan, Alabama are, quite literally, living in fear   and with good reason. Their police chief, Steven Parrish, is an open member of a neo- Confederate organization by the name of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Even worse is the fact that officials in Dothan are fully behind Parrish keeping his job as police chief, despite his ties to a clearly racist organization.During a Tuesday government meeting, Dothan Mayor Schmitz allowed just one person in support of Parrish and one against him to speak. Paul Carroll, one of Dothan s black residents, said to the meeting: This would never happen to the Jewish community. You would never see someone who s a neo-Nazi being made chief of police, but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo-Confederate? Carroll also said to local paper the Dothan Eagle: We are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections? I don t (feel safe). Sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority. And Carroll has good reason to feel that way, as Parrish openly says he is a Sons of Confederate Veterans  Commander.  So, it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization, but he has to be a commander. It is also believed (but not proven) that Parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force.Another of the city s black residents, Ruth Nelson, says of Parrish s reign as chief: This is a nightmare. And when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this..they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth. Resident Kevin Saffold alluded to the idea that the city of Dothan would soon be in an uproar if the Parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction: If you don t want this to be another Ferguson, if you don t want civil unrest, if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative, then you should do something about that. I believe in the court system and I believe in justice   I don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field. All of these residents are right, and they have every right to be outraged and afraid. After all, there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist POS.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Jeb Bush Blames Bad Parenting For Black Crime: Says His Own Kids’ Crimes ‘Not His Fault’ (VIDEO),"Earlier this year, Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, which were tied to predatory policing of African-Americans that led to murder-by-cop.Via Think Progress:During a Q & A with employees of the pharmaceutical company Nephron, his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. Kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning,  Bush said.  They ve never been challenged to achieve far better. They ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better. You see what happens in Baltimore and Ferguson. You see the tragedies play out. You see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific. Jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege-ridden Republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the African-American community   blame the parents.Fast forward 7 months later:During an interview with CBS Miami, the topic of Jeb s daughter Noelle came up. Jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs. The interviewer specifically asked if Jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as Governor,  if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems.Listen to Jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via CBS Miami:  I can t blame myself. That s not gonna solve any problems, and you just can t do that. Jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity. However, as you saw above, if you are black and live in a city that means it s YOUR family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity.Here is some history on Jeb s daughter. In 2002, Noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a Xanax prescription in Tallahassee. A judge sentenced her to rehab. In July 2002, she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program. In October 2002, Noelle was jailed again for 10 more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center. In 2003, she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since.These are 3 crimes that were drug related in less than one year. She spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it.It s relevant to know that during Jeb s first year as Florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors, including a 3-year minimum for as little as 4 grams of heroin. He also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses. Bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed 10,000 drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs. Somehow Jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield.One final bit of annoyance Jeb s son George P. Bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend s home while drunk when he was 18 years old. He walked when charges were not pressed.What an elitist Republican jerk   Jeb Bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems, while laying ALL the problems African-American people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Stolen Valor: Men In Oregon ‘Militia’ Caught Red-Handed Falsely Posing As Marine Veterans,"Two of the men involved in the armed standoff in Oregon have been caught falsely claiming to have served in the Marines. An investigation shows the two have committed stolen valor. One of the men, Brian Cavalier, is the personal bodyguard to Ammon Bundy and has told reporters that he served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Here s the problem: the US Marine Corps has no record of his service. That s because he was never enlisted. The other man, Blaine Cooper, also claimed to be a Marine, but he was only in the  Delayed Entry Program.  He dropped out before actually going to boot camp.A more in-depth look reveals that Cavalier is just a tattoo artist, and not only that, but the only record he has is a rap sheet full of DUI s and theft   nothing even affiliated with the military. That s what police records show, anyhow. It appears he faked his military credentials so he would be more credible to serve in the Oregon gang and get more street cred.Here was the encounter Brian Cavalier had with reporters, who hilariously goes by the nickname  Raging Unicorn: I m a retired United States Marine, I can rage. He also tried to sound ex-military when one journalist asked to access the refuge building, stating boldly: No, that s logistical security issues that we can t have happen, head count can t be divulged for security purposes. When he was later confronted about his false claims, and that the US Marine Corps had confirmed that he was in fact never a Marine, he reportedly got very nervous, saying: That s unfortunate that someone would say that. I m not commenting on anything. I told you what it is. Pic via Latest.No service member who served would ever cower away like that. But, his reply wasn t needed. These guys are fakes   the evidence already proves that. While claiming to have served in the military isn t technically against the law, it s not respectful to the men and women who actually did risk their lives for their country. The 2013 Stolen Valor Act only makes it unlawful if someone falsely claims to have received an award or commendation to receive some form of compensation. Neither of these men violated that.With that said   we have a feeling stolen valor isn t going to be as much of an issue when the FBI presses federal charges against them when this is all over and done with. That much is guaranteed.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 7, 2016"
 The Most Conservative States Depend Far More On Federal Aid – This Proves It (IMAGE),"A new analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group devoted to educating taxpayers, shows that some of the most conservative states in the nation are the most dependent on the federal government. Really? How can this be, you say? Republicans hate the federal government, right? While some conservative states certainly do, the reddest states (most particularly the Bible Belt in the south) actually rely on Uncle Sam far more than the most liberal states in the nation. It s pretty hilarious, actually.Looking at the data, you ll see that five of the ten most conservative states in the country are considered to be in the top 10 (out of 50) that are most reliant on the federal government. The numbers are calculated as a share of government revenue coming from the Fed, as opposed to self-reliant sources within their own state. Each state is given a percentage (located on the map below). This can include Medicaid payments, education funding, infrastructure financing, grants, etc.Pic via GallopGo ahead and take a look. You will see that Mississippi is #1 in both categories; it s the most conservative and the neediest. That s just one example. We have a feeling that each state would turn blue real quick if Republicans got their way on most of their economic policies directed towards the poor. This proves that some of the most conservative states in the country would barely be able to get by without the federal government.Pic via Washington PostSee where California ranks? Not only is it the most populous (by far), but it s considered to be one of the top six most liberal states, you know, the sort that passes all kinds of progressive reforms conservatives claim to hate. Well, guess what? It s one of the LEAST dependent on Uncle Sam. That s right   the state s liberal politicians do a better job generating revenue by itself   i.e. creating jobs, making sure education is a priority, all those liberal ideas that actually make a difference in people s lives   without needing as much help.It s information like this that is sure to blow the mind of any Republican reading it   that is if they re open minded enough to digest objective facts. But, we know better than this. Conservatives don t care about facts. They just know they hate welfare   anyone else receiving welfare; just not the monies they personally get.Featured image via Wikipedia.",News,"January 7, 2016"
" WATCH: Fox News Just Sided With President Obama On Gun Control- What Now, NRA? (VIDEO)","Hell just froze over, because Fox News is now on President Obama s side when it comes to his new gun safety executive order.Bill O Reilly said, during a segment on The O Reilly Factor, that the NRA and gun owners need to accept that background checks for buying guns are reasonable.I know how unbelievable that sounds, but here it is in a video:Could we possibly have hit a point where the Republican establishment has finally had it with the monster they created in 2008? Has the NRA and its head idiot, Wayne LaPierre, finally become caricatures of themselves that are too embarrassing even for people like Bill O Reilly and Fox News?Here is something that I never, ever thought I would say in my life: I agree with Bill O Reilly, especially on the part about being paranoid. However, there is one part where Bill just had to veer back into the realm of stupidity so he could throw his audience a bone   likely to prevent them from throwing a beer can through their TV screen at home. Bill openly addressed President Obama while saying a firearm registry will not solve America s gun problem.The sudden burst of common sense from Bill couldn t last forever. It is a well documented, checked fact that President Obama does not want to create a gun registry. This was proven when the last universal background check bill completely outlawed the creation of one.Obama s openly accused the NRA of lying about this, from a Rose Garden press conference: They claimed that it would create some sort of  big brother  gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn t matter. The latest Quinnipiac poll, from December 23, 2015, shows background checks have an absolutely MASSIVE amount of support across the board.Photo: QuinnipiacIt has had this kind of support since after the Sandy Hook massacre, give or take a relatively negligible variance in points, so to act like all of a sudden it is  reasonable  is strange at best.Regardless of the details, the simple fact that Fox News   and Bill O Reilly in particular   are siding with President Obama on gun control is nothing short of a noteworthy event in American history. The internal Republican fallout will be amazing to watch.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 7, 2016"
 John McCain Goes Full-On Birther — Tries To Get Ted Cruz Disqualified From Race,"It s no secret that Senator John McCain hates Ted Cruz. Although he has tried to hide it by repeatedly calling the Republican presidential candidate a  friend,  it s hard to look past the time he called him a  wacko bird. He has also been very vocal about his disdain for Cruz s government shutdown tactics and in 2015 he said that he basically disagrees with the candidate s entire platform. With all of this in mind, it was really no surprise when McCain added his opinion to the Ted Cruz citizenship controversy.By now, you have probably all heard about Donald Trump questioning whether or not Ted Cruz was qualified to be president because he was born in Canada. The Constitution says that only a  natural-born  citizen can sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, and the GOP front-runner implied that he didn t know if Cruz was a legal candidate.During an interview on Wednesday on Phoenix radio station 550 KFYI s Chris Merill Show, John McCain said  he didn t know  if Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada: I know that came up in my race because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the Canal Zone which is a territory. Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona when it was territory when he ran in 1964. .Asked if the Supreme Court might have to weigh in on the  natural born citizen  issue, McCain said,  It may be, that may be the case. It is likely that John McCain doesn t really question whether or not Cruz is eligible to be president; instead it seems as though he was trolling the senator a little bit. But if he does actually question his right to run, he may be trying to get the party to disqualify the Tea Party maniac.Although McCain has made some pretty stupid political decisions in the past (cough..Sarah Palin cough), he is basically a moderate Republican and not as loony as the Teabillies who have hijacked his party. That means he knows that even though the Constitution does not specifically define  natural born citizen,  the consensus is that if a person is born to American parents, even in a foreign country, they are  natural born. What s really funny about this whole non-scandal is that we are seeing the Republican Party target their own candidate in the same way many attacked President Obama   and he was actually born in the United States.Oh the irony Featured image via Salon",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Huge Progressive Group Demands Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Immediately Resign As DNC Chair,"Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been under a tremendous amount of fire lately for what some Democrats perceive as a vendetta against Senator Bernie Sanders. Liberals have accused the DNC chair of  fixing  the primary in Hillary Clinton s favor and there have been many calls for her to step aside. Now, a large progressive group is adding their voice to the fray after comments the chairwoman made in the New York Times Magazine about Roe v. Wade.CREDO Mobile, a phone company that uses their profits to fund liberal causes and has a network of more than 3.6 million people, started a petition calling for Wasserman-Schultz s resignation. The petition was prompted by an interview that was published Wednesday morning in which the chairwoman said there is  a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided. The comments garnered immediate backlash as women took to Twitter and lashed out at her using the hashtag #DearDebbie. She later clarified her remarks, saying: For many in my generation who lived the majority of our lives with the right to make our own health care choices, there wasn t a sense of urgency after Roe v. Wade settled our right to a safe and legal abortion. Since then, opponents worked aggressively to chip away at women s reproductive freedom and they have awakened a sleeping giant in the millennials leading the fight in defense of the progress we ve made. CREDO fired back at Wasserman-Schultz with the petition demanding she step down, claiming:Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz just accused young women of  complacency  in the fight for abortion rights.Young women, especially low income women and women of color, have been bearing the brunt of the right-wing s relentless assault on abortion rights and have been leading the charge to fight back. Wasserman Schultz s comment shows how out of touch she is with the progressive core values of the Democratic activist base, and is just the latest in a string of unacceptable actions that makes it clear it is time for her to resign as chair of the DNC.The group also accused her of rigging the primary to  suppress Democratic turnout,  putting her personal interests before the party, trying to sabotage the president s Iran deal, and siding  with anti-progressive special interests. Whether you agree with CREDO or not, the debacle on Wednesday and the others in the months leading up to it, show that there is a rift forming in the party that is not good for us. With the primaries right around the corner and the general election just months away, we need to unite for the good of our party. The infighting is unhealthy and the more divided we become, the better the chances are that we could see a Republican in the White House. Do you really want a President Donald Trump or President Ted Cruz?It is time to put our differences aside and focus on beating the GOP in November; we can handle everything else afterward.Featured image via Florida Politics",News,"January 7, 2016"
 The White House Had WAY Too Much Fun Trolling Birthers Over Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"For seven years there s been several folks, let s call them birthers, who have questioned the validity of President Obama s United States citizenship. These people refuse to believe that the president was born in Hawaii, and refuse to believe that even if he wasn t (he was), that he was born to an American citizen, his mother. When it comes down to it, it s not that they question the validity of Obama so much as they question the validity of having a black president. After all, he doesn t look like any other former president, so he must not be from here, right? Wrong.Now, if birthers really wanted to go after someone vying for the Oval Office, they, quite literally, could go after Senator Ted Cruz. You see, Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen. However, just like Obama he was born to an American citizen, so he is, in fact, a natural-born citizen as the Constitution stipulates, but if you re going to go after anyone for being foreign-born, Cruz makes a much better target.Lately on the campaign trail, Captain Birther himself, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, has brought up the legitimacy of Ted Cruz s ability to run for president. He s even gone so far as to want Cruz to  go before a judge  to make a ruling on his citizenship.Getting a good giggle from all of this was none other than White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who, when asked about Cruz and this line of questioning regarding citizenship, answered: It would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the President s birth certificate, if Republican primary voters were to choose Senator Cruz as their nominee. Somebody who actually wasn t born in the United States and only 18 months ago renounced his Canadian citizenship. Which is very true. If these Republican birthers, who were so angry at the make-believe possibility that Obama was not born in the nation actually vote for a man who, in all legitimacy, wasn t born in the country, it would not only be ironic, it would be hypocritical, and prove the entire birther movement is steeped in racism.It s impressive that Earnest was able to hold himself together as much as he did after that question was asked.

 Brokeback Bundy: Hilarious Hashtag Mocks What The Militia Is Getting Up To In The Woods,"The Bundy brothers and their militia continue to play patriots at an Oregon wildlife reserve, but the rest of the world hasn t joined in their revolution. In fact, people are getting really good at mocking them.As the FBI announced that it would be cutting off power to the building and supplies have already begun to run low (who knew you needed more than a few boxes of Ramen noodles to sustain you on an months-long occupation of a federal building?), things are looking pretty desperate for the anti-government fanatics hold up within. It s an open question of how long they will stubbornly insist on staying out in the cold to prove how macho they are.Other than a few baffling interviews, and one hilarious blue tarp, the Bundy s have been mostly quiet.

The relentless mocking paired with the group s own embarrassing moments in front of the camera have made even sympathetic right-wing anti-government nut jobs like Sean Hannity recoil.When you ve lost Hannity, you ve lost your right-wing revolution.Ironically, it turns out that all the guns they brought along with them while they were dreaming of a showdown with the government didn t stand a chance against the relentless mockery they have received from the internet. Their cause was doomed to fail, but it s hard to imagine they anticipated it failing because people couldn t stop laughing at them. That probably stings a lot worse than the cold wind.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 7, 2016"
 Micheal Moore Demands MI Republican Gov. Be Arrested For Poisoning Flint’s Water (IMAGE),"Michael Moore has joined others in calling for U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder for not preventing lead from contaminating the city of Flint s water system. Moore was born and raised in Flint, MI. His first documentary film, Roger & Me, chronicles the downfall of Flint and explains how its demise was orchestrated by big business and conservative policy.Moore posted a photo of himself on social media that shows him holding a pair of handcuffs. In his other hand, Moore is holding up a sign which reads, #ArrestGovSnyder. Activists have been using the hash tag to call attention to Flint s water crisis, and Snyder s culpability in the matter.https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153223367636857/?type=3&theaterAccompanying the photo, is a letter written by Moore condemning Snyder over the crisis. Moore Writes: Dear Governor Snyder:Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.And for that, you have to go to jail.To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven t figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.By taking away the city s clean drinking water in order to  cut costs,  and then switching the city s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created. Moore argues that Snyder is a criminal, and should be arrested for switching the city s water source to the Flint River, which caused the contamination. Moore argues: Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don t like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you   and this time, I hope, it s going to convict you. Other celebrities have been quick to fire off on Snyder after the hashtag surfaced.

 FBI: Bundy and His Band Of Domestic Terrorists Will Face Federal Charges When Their Tantrum Ends,"Federal authorities have no intention of killing the Bundy brothers and their traitorous followers. They d rather arrest them and put them behind bars.Thus far, the federal government has been incredibly tolerant of the armed white rednecks currently occupying a federal wildlife refuge building in Oregon.The militants would like to engage federal law enforcement in a firefight to the death, but seeing as how authorities are planning to cut electricity to the building and the fact that the men had to beg for supplies because they failed to prepare for the long haul, it won t be long before the cold winter and hunger force them to surrender.The FBI and Sheriff s office are counting the felonies and misdemeanors each member of the group has committed since the beginning of their stunt, and according to Harney County Sheriff David Ward, the FBI intends to arrest them and make them pay the consequences for their actions. The bureau has assured me that those at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will at some point face charges,  Ward told Oregon Public Broadcasting on Tuesday. He then warned the militant that things will only get worse for them the longer they refuse to surrender.  They have an opportunity right now to work towards a better solution, and not face further charges,  he said.Indeed, right now the group faces charges of sedition and treason against the United States. In addition, they also face charges for breaking and entering, carrying guns on federal property, and trespassing, just to name a few.If found guilty of a felony, they would also be departed from the ones they love the most their guns.So while the federal government isn t going in with guns blazing, they are taking steps to end the pathetic little rebellion and are waiting to place each domestic terrorist in shiny metal bracelets.To help speed up the process, Sheriff Ward also pleaded for people to stop sending supplies to the militants. I think if one person gives them a Snickers bar, they re going on national media and claiming that the community supports them. If you re giving them support, you re just prolonging the situation. Here s the audio via Oregon Public Broadcasting.It s been a rough week for Bundy and his buddies. Not only have they been roundly condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, they can t even catch a break from Fox News and have been mercilessly mocked across the country, becoming a national punchline.For now, all we can do is wait for Bundy and crew tuck their tails between their legs and surrender to see if the FBI keeps their word that they will face charges for their crimes. Until then, let the mockery continue.Featured Image: Wise Geek",News,"January 6, 2016"
 This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed,"When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it. Period.Featured image via KIRO7",News,"January 6, 2016"
" Bristol Palin Being Sued For Custody And Child Support, Probably Wishes She Had Practiced Abstinence Now","Bristol Palin brought this upon herself. After all, she could have just practiced what she preached. Now, it s her turn to take responsibility.But she didn t, and now the daughter of America s village idiot has a second out-of-wedlock baby by a second dude, who now wants Bristol to pay him child support as well as give him joint physical custody of the little girl named Sailor Grace.Palin has already been embroiled in battles with her other baby daddy Levi Johnston over their 7-year-old son Tripp. And now she gets to battle Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.According to legal documents obtained by Radar Online: The parties have reached a final custody and visitation agreement for residing in the same community and have executed, personally and through their attorneys, a confidential stipulation regarding custody. Therefore, the only pending issue to be addressed by the Court is the matter of past and future child support. And Bristol Palin isn t the struggling single mom she pretends to be. She has a lot of money to make child support payments.After getting knocked up and giving birth the first time around, Palin became a paid spokesperson for for an abstinence-only campaign, making $262,000 in 2009 alone. And then she got a $100,000 payday by selling her story to In Touch Weekly. And Palin owned a $400,000 modern lakefront home in Alaska, pictures of which you can see here.Combine all of that with the millions of dollars her mom has suckered from conservatives across the country via donations and book sales and it becomes quite clear that Bristol can afford to pay child support.One would think Bristol would learn her lesson by now. But apparently she s quite comfortable being paid to preach abstinence while having sex and babies with any guy she meets. The hypocrisy is stunning and makes it hard to feel sorry for her.For years now, she has criticized women and girls for being irresponsible when it comes to sex and birth control. Now it s time for her to take responsibility for her own actions, which means she should have to pay child support in a timely manner so that her child can have at least one parent who has some discipline and isn t a spoiled brat who whines all the time.Featured Image: Inquistr",News,"January 6, 2016"
 All Talk NRA Refuses Chance To Debate Obama Over Gun Control On Live TV,"Apparently the only thing the National Rifle Association and the White House can agree on is that President Obama would smoke them in a debate on gun control.CNN extended an invitation to the NRA, the nation s most powerful gun lobby, to join Obama during a live town hall on Thursday evening in Virginia to discuss the issue of gun violence. They gracelessly declined.NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam seemed willing to assume the NRA would come out of the debate looking very badly. He claimed the White House would rig the event and turn it into a  public relations spectacle. In other words, the NRA believes it would lose and Arulanandam is desperate to think of a good excuse as to why that is.Undermining this excuse, however, is the fact that it is CNN, not Obama, that is organizing the event.A CNN spokesperson said that it was the network, not the White House, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the Second Amendment including NRA members as well as groups that back gun regulation.The only ones too afraid to show up to this mixed crowd are NRA representatives.And while it s laughable that the NRA already threw in the towel before the debate even began, they are justified in being worried about what they would face if they were brave enough to show up. As Obama proved numerous times during his two presidential elections, he s a formidable debate opponent. It is also clear that the issue of gun control is an area that Obama is fired up about. For years, Republicans in Washington and their pro-gun benefactors have stymied any and all attempts to address mass shootings. Entering his last year in office, Obama is done playing games. Earlier this week, he gave an emotional and powerful speech about the need for better gun control   and what he plans to do about it. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  Obama said.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  he added.The NRA seems content to fight against any conceivable campaign to stop needless gun violence. This includes floating reckless lies that Obama is a tyrant seizing people s guns. On social media, the lobbying group regularly promotes misinformation to its gullible followers. They aren t used to being called out on it.Now that it is time to actually face Obama, it s no wonder they can t do it.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 6, 2016"
 College Moves to Fire Christian Professor For Saying Christians And Muslims Worship Same God (VIDEO),"Professor Larycia Alaine Hawkins upset administrators at Wheaton College when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. Wheaton College, which touts itself as a Christian school, also had a problem with Hawkins when she said that Muslims and Christians worship the same God, quoting Pope Francis.  In a statement, Wheaton College initiated a termination-for-cause proceeding against Professor Larycia Hawkins on Tuesday, saying Hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues.Here is the Facebook post that Wheaton found problematic://  I don t love my Muslim neighbor because s/he is American. I love my Muslim neighbor because s/he deserves love by virtue of her/his human dignity. I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa that I had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in 2014. I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. But as I tell my students, theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all. Thus, beginning tonight, my solidarity has become embodied solidarity. As part of my Advent Worship, I will wear the hijab to work at Wheaton College, to play in Chi-town, in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti-Sharia laws (read: unconstitutional and Islamophobic), and at church. I invite all women into the narrative that is embodied, hijab-wearing solidarity with our Muslim sisters for whatever reason. A large scale movement of Women in Solidarity with Hijabs is my Christmas  # wish  this year. Perhaps you are a Muslim who does not wear the veil normally. Perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable. Perhaps you are a Catholic or Protestant Christian like me. Perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship, but not a hijab. I would like to add that I have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent Muslim organizations in the United States, the Council on American Islamic Relations,  # CAIR , where I have a friend and Board colleague on staff. I asked whether a non-Muslim wearing the hijab was haram (forbidden), patronizing, or otherwise offensive to Muslims. I was assured by my friends at CAIR-Chicago that they welcomed the gesture. So please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity; human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic, sentiment. The statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and Islamophobia by firing this courageous woman. Professors also have the right to academic freedom. One can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues. One of the most cherished aspects of the American way is the right to freedom of speech. Wheaton College has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor. A petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor.Here is what Illinois Committee A on Academic Freedom had to say about Wheaton s actions: There can be no doubt that Wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for Muslims is an attack on academic freedom. But what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the Christian values of loving thy neighbor that Wheaton pretends to embrace. The administration at Wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for, they are also betraying the values of Wheaton College itself. Here is Professor Hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRRq3SdcBo] Show your support for Professor Hawkins by signing and sharing this petition.Featured image: screegrab",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Watch The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre Support Then Oppose Then Support Firearm Background Checks (VIDEO),"It s no secret that NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre is totally fricking nuts. Unfortunately for him, his newest online video won t ameliorate his reputation for being a well-financed escaped mental patient.Cutting to the chase, LaPierre s video goes something like this:1) Background checks should be expanded. 2) Background checks shouldn t be expanded. 3) The NRA helped create background checks!I m not exaggerating. LaPierre opens by discussing how the NRA has been actively pushing for the background check system to be augmented to include mental health records, which, LaPierre says, would ve prevented a long list of recent mass shootings. By the way, smart move, Wayne. Thanks for reminding us about some of the most tragic gun related killing sprees of our lifetime. I m not sure whether acknowledging the roster of homicidal killers is the best way to pitch the NRA s pro-gun position, but there it is.He continued by taking a sharp right-hand turn   criticizing the expansion of background checks to include gun shows and internet sales after having just seconds earlier supporting the idea. See, apparently expanding background checks to include mentally ill people is somehow better than expanding them to include gun shows.The video wraps with yet another whiplash-inducing pivot. LaPierre explains how the NRA was instrumental in establishing the National Instant Check System in the first place, an obvious admission that the NRA once supported a gun-regulation measure, the expansion of which is now inexplicably forbidden.Okeedokee.The bottom line: yes, the system could be heftier. The problem is that LaPierre and his flying monkeys spend millions of dollars intimidating or buying-off lawmakers who render ineffective any efforts to improve the system. In other words, any weaknesses in the system can almost entirely be blamed on the NRA. And if a bill that fortifies the system is introduced, the NRA will inevitably kill it. Why? Anything that makes it more difficult for consumers to buy guns will be opposed simply because the NRA is solely tasked with selling guns. LaPierre knows the Second Amendment is nothing more than a convenient marketing gimmick for selling deadly weapons to sociopaths.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLTMkg1RLW0]Featured image via video screen grab",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Alabama’s Chief Justice Just Spit On The Constitution: Reinstates Ban On Gay Marriage,"One would think that to hold a position like Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court you would have to know a thing or two about the law. Justice Roy Moore, the same guy who lost a battle and his job over the statue of the Ten Commandments in the Alabama State House, is looking to once again defy the Supreme Court of the United States and the Constitution he is sworn to uphold and protect.Moore sent word on Wednesday that the SCOTUS ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide doesn t apply to Alabama. Citing the fact that the case was ruled on for other states   not Alabama   and how right Kim Davis was to refuse to do her job, Moore laid down the gantlet to his next impeachment.Apparently Moore doesn t quite understand how the judicial branch of the federal government works, nor does he understand the 14th Amendment. The gay marriage ruling was specifically intended to extend the rights of couples in one state to all states in the union.Pesky little things like facts, procedure and protocol don t matter to Moore, whose Administrative Order reads: Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect, Moore and other opponents of equality have said there is confusion about the actual meaning of the Supreme Court s historic Obergefell v Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in every state in the union. Confusion and uncertainty exist among the probate judges of this state as to the effect of Obergefell on the  existing orders,'  he wrote.Those  existing orders,  essentially an archaic ban on a now-legal practice, were more than clarified when a federal judge ordered in July that the SCOTUS ruling was binding on all probate judges in Alabama. Judges from two counties have discontinued licensing for the time being, but could ultimately face the same fate as Kim Davis if they continue to violate a federal order.Roy Moore told CNN that the vendetta he has against same-sex marriage isn t a religious issue; it s about the law. Roy Moore is full of crap. He is and always has been nothing but a southern crusader for Christianity.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016"
 The FIVE Most Ridiculous Things Done So Far By These Make-Believe ‘Patriots’ In Oregon,"Last Saturday, a bunch of well-armed  militiamen  decided to protest the extended sentence of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, who started fires on federal land near their property. The federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence. And according to Rolling Stone: The first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences, which they served. But the U.S. attorney in the case called foul; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence. In October 2015, the Ninth Circuit imposed the mandatory minimum, ruling that:  given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.  The ranchers are due back in federal prison Monday to serve out their five years each. Well, not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long, Ammon Bundy, son of the infamous anti-government imbecile Cliven Bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) not too long ago, decided he would involve himself in the fight against  tyranny  of government against these law-breaking ranchers. Bundy, and his band of merry morons, decided to take over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. He posted a video to Facebook where he declared: We have basically taken over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. And this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here. And we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms. Maybe they don t need their legs?Well, needless to say, the government isn t being  tyrannical,  but rather following the laws as they are written. These  militiamen  may not like the laws, but that s what elections are for   you vote in the people who make the laws. You don t hold armed protests, or rather hissy fits, in an empty wildlife refuge.Nonetheless, in no particular order, here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe  Patriots  in Oregon:If there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere, you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled. And not disappointing us in the slightest, the Bundy  Militia   made sure to offer some doozies. Looks like maybe they could have used some of that  tyranical goverment  [sic] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comOne of the  Patriots,  Jon Ritzenheimer, even made a goodbye video for his family.

 Father Furious When TSA Agent Frisks 10-Year-Old Daughter In Two-Minute Pat Down (VIDEO/IMAGE),"A 10-year-old girl s awful experience with a TSA agent is now making national headlines after she was forced to undergo an inappropriately long and invasive pat down.Vendela Payne had been traveling back home to California with her family when she was stopped by a TSA agent at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Vendela had accidentally left a Capri Sun drink in her bag as she went through the security line and was flagged for further screening   which is when her travel experience changed drastically.Removed from her family, Vendela was forced to endure an uncomfortable pat down that lasted two uncomfortably long minutes. Her father, Kevin Payne, was on the other side of the glass and began recording the entire screening as he noticed  it was an uncomfortable situation. In the video footage below, you can see how lengthy, repetitive and invasive the pat down was, as Kevin repeatedly calls out the TSA s actions in the overlaying text:If you didn t observe how uncomfortable the pat-down made Vendela feel by her frozen, blank stare in the video, she spoke about the traumatizing experience in an interview with NBC. The young girl said she kept trying not to  throw a tantrum like a 1-year-old. : My dad was making funny faces silly faces in the mirror and I felt like screaming the whole time. I know it s to keep everybody on the plane safe, but she kept patting me down. Pat down, pat down. It was like, over and over. TSA agent pats down Vendela s chestWhile Kevin says that he supports airport security policies and safety procedures, he agrees with his daughter that the TSA agent was inappropriate during the pat down. He said: I m a very big proponent of security, and if they were patting me down no problem, but this was a 10-year-old girl. The whole system seems to not work the way it should be working. They gave her a very standard pat-down for an adult female. I don t think it was modified one bit. If you look at videos, most pat-downs on adults (take) about a minute. Start to finish, in real time, (Vendala s pat-down) was 1 minute and 47 seconds. It just didn t seem like it was an efficient pat-down. The TSA s website states that screenings are meant to determine if prohibited items are being hidden under clothing and that agents will use sufficient pressure to detect concealed items. However, the site also says that screening procedures for kids 12 and under have been modified so that children are not likely to undergo a pat down screening. In Vendela s case, her father believes that the agent chose the pat down screening without considering other options.",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Trump-Supporting Gun Nut Holds AR-15 Like A Baby During The Most Bizarre Interview Ever (VIDEO),"Gun nuts are a strange breed. They are paranoid, uneducated, and don t feel complete without a few penis extensions guns fully locked and loaded at all times. However, one ammosexual just took it a step further, by holding on to his beloved AR-15 during an interview on CNN.Who is this guy and why is he allowed anywhere near guns, you might ask? This guy actually is New Hampshire s own Mark Limoges, owner of Black Op Arms gun store. He s also a Donald Trump supporter, and he showed up to the interview with a perfect copy of the AR-15 that he lovingly presented to The Donald himself. Limoges told the show s hosts: This is an exact replica of the gun we gave Mr. Trump. It has our Black Ops Arms symbol on it with our Black Ops Arms symbol on the handrail. And the other side, we have the  Live Free or Die  with the American flag on the handrail. He did, however, admit that Trump s Secret Service detail was more than a little concerned about both the visit to the gun store and the gift of an assault rifle. Limoges goes on to explain how that was handled: We actually wanted Mr. Trump to come to our gun store, which the Secret Service was not real thrilled about. A Secret Service agent came to the store, took the gun. We removed the bolt out of it. They took possession of the weapon and then presented it to us before we went into the room to present it to Mr. Trump. Limoges also admitted that the weapon he give the GOP front runner would be illegal in Trump s home state of New York without modifications. Then, of course, he had to go and accuse President Obama of attempting to seize guns, saying: I think it s probably a first step towards it, yes. Host John Berman seemed surprised, and said,  Really?  in response.Berman s co-host Kate Bolduan challenged this assertion, reminding Limoges that President Obama explicitly says that he has no such plans: The president said yesterday in his speech that his actions are not a plot to take away everybody s guns. This statement led to Limoges accusing the president of being a liar on live television: Mr. Obama has also said other things that have not always been the truth. Berman went on to press Limoges: Look, he says he respects the Second Amendment. And if you just look at the actions he s taking, even the things he was proposing a few years ago which were steeper than this, even if you support universal background checks, that doesn t necessarily mean you want to take someone s guns away. Limoges  mind was not changed, though, and he concluded: Most of the people that come in [to the gun store] are real nervous about what Mr. Obama is going to do to limit their chances of getting weapons. Maybe that s why he insisted on keeping his AR-15 cradled so closely for the duration. Obama could come take it during the five minutes he was talking to those lovely CNN hosts.Get some help, Mr. Limoges. You clearly need it.Watch the entire bizarre exchange below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Joe Scarborough Defends President Obama’s Emotional Announcement On Gun Control (VIDEO),"While it s often difficult to notice, Joe Scarborough is one of the remaining few  reasonable  Republicans. Of course, this has a lot to do with his party s radical shift to its far-right flank, backed with the ascension of Donald Trump. Consequently, certain Republicans such as Scarborough, who at one time sounded radical, sound rational today. To his credit, Scarborough has often sidestepped partisanship to give credit where credit is due.Such was the case Wednesday morning when the host of MSNBC s Morning Joe vocally defended President Obama s executive order on gun control.Scarborough and co-host Mike Barnacle elaborated on the president s announcement, and agreed that expanding background checks for gun sales is an eminently reasonable action to take. Scarborough made sure to underscore for his unhinged conservative viewers that Obama didn t say anything about grabbing any guns. He also validated the president s genuine sadness and anger when mentioning Sandy Hook during his remarks.Via Media Matters:SCARBOROUGH: You see the frustration, don t you, in every press conference after every mass shooting, the president being frustrated by his inability to get anything done even when 90 percent of Americans support stronger background checks.BARNICLE: Absolutely, Joe. And living with the knowledge that you have to provide more information to become a Little League baseball coach than you do to a gun show.SCABOROUGH: Look at this. So if you re driving, a lot of people are listening to us as they drive into work. We re showing a Quinnipiac University poll that actually shows 89 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases at gun shows. Eighty-seven percent Republicans, 87 percent. And as other pollsters have told us, up to 80 percent of Republicans in early primary states, who vote in early primary states, support background checks. And, this is not a prediction. I m just going to tell you how it s going to be. There are going to continue to be mass shootings. Terrorists are going to continue to do it over the next decade. And the things that I ve been talking about on background checks and all of us have been talking about and the president has been talking about, Republicans, it s going to be the Republican position within the next two, three, four years. I say Jim VandeHei, one of the things that was most astounding yesterday was the reaction. The Pavlovian reaction from Republicans over a set of actions that really weren t far reaching. And even the White House will tell you, they were modest at best. He hopes he can do something to start the gun show loopholes so terrorist can t walk in and buy guns. But it wasn t even that, and I m not knocking him, it wasn t that sweeping. Nobody got any guns taken away yesterday.And, of course, Joe is correct. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 95 percent of Democrats and 87 percent of Republicans support background checks. Back in 2014, 92 percent of gun owners supported expanding the regulation. Yet, when the Manchin-Toomey amendment was proposed back in 2013, the Senate GOP filibustered the legislation in defiance of nearly 90 percent of its voters. Why? Three words: National Rifle Association. The only constituency that matters to the congressional Republicans. It s an almost awe-inspiring dynamic   the NRA s extremist agenda is a higher legislative priority for the GOP than 87 percent of Republican voters.Furthermore, the president s order is, as Scarborough said, not that  far reaching.  Back in 2013, the president announced much more stringent and comprehensive regulations on gun ownership. The president, at the time, tried to resurrect the expired assault weapons ban and close all of the loopholes created by the NRA in 1994. There were bullet control  proposals: no more magazines larger than 10 rounds, and no more armor-piercing bullets. Today, however, the president s actions are limited to just the background checks and additional funding for the FBI and ATF. Nothing else. But that won t stop the relentless lies and fear-mongering by the GOP, telling its people that Obama s out to confiscate their guns. As much as I d like it to happen, it won t.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 6, 2016"
" Watch Trump Mock His Moronic Supporters To Their Faces, And They’re Too Stupid To Notice (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump knows how to do really well, even better than most, it s sell things. And in this case, that  thing  isn t real estate or a television show or a book, but rather just himself. With the phrase  Make America Great Again,  with no further explanation besides loving guns, hating Mexicans, and lowering taxes, he s gotten a rather large following to support him.Being the salesman that he is, he doesn t care who supports him as long as they do. He uses simplistic phrases on purpose, because he knows that most of his supporters likely don t have above a third grade reading level. He plays to the stupid vote, but calls them smart and the  most intelligent  because, after all, they are voting for him.However, at a recent campaign event in Claremont, New Hampshire, Trump seemed to let it slip that he knows his supporters are an army of loyal idiots. After reciting poll after poll after poll, which seems to be all these events are, self-congratulatory events for himself, he told the crowd that no one is ever leaving him. No matter what he says, or how awful he behaves, he knows he has the support of this moronic base.He said: Did you see? One of the things that came out in the one poll, nobody s ever leaving me. I could be the worst person in the world, they re not leaving. Continuing, he said: If I was up here and did some really inappropriate things, my people stay. I love you people. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love my people! They re the most loyal. And if that wasn t bad enough, he then comes out and says it: I m winning with the smart people, I m winning with the not-so-smart people, too. I m winning with everything. With all of this he got cheers and shouts of  I love you!  and  We love you!  from the crowd of unsuspecting nincompoops.Trump knows exactly what he s doing, which is actually what makes his run for the Oval Office so terrifying. He plays to the simplistic and imbecilic minded in the nation, and they lap it up with a spoon. Trump doesn t care that his voters are dumb. I mean, hell, George W. Bush won in 2004 after 9/11 and starting a war based on lies. There is definitely a base of voters in this nation who shouldn t be allowed to operate heavy machinery, including a voting machine.

 Stephen Colbert Mercilessly And Hilariously Mocks Unprepared Bundy Terrorists (VIDEO),"In a glorious segment on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert piled on the mockery of the anti-government loons who took over a federal wildlife refuge building without preparing for the long haul.When Ammon and Ryan Bundy seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, they were hoping to ignite a war against the federal government. Instead, the federal government ignored them and most of America laughed at them and the right-wing militia movement became an even bigger joke than it has ever been.The armed militants have been labeled  Y all qaeda  and  Vanilla ISIS  and drew even more ridicule after having to beg people to send them snacks through the US Postal Service because they somehow forgot to prepare for a long occupation. Ammon Bundy has even backed away from his brother s claim that the group came there to kill or be killed during an embarrassing interview with Megyn Kelly.Clearly, Bundy s pathetic rebellion has very little support. And Stephen Colbert only added more mockery on Tuesday night. I haven t seen this many angry, bearded men in Oregon since I referred to Blue Moon as a craft beer,  Colbert quipped. These confused, fragile, heavily armed creatures need someplace to live where civilization won t upset them. They re clearly endangered, although it s hard to know exactly how many there are because their camo is so good. Here s one standing between two bushes, I believe. Sadly, there s no hope of establishing a breeding program because, frankly, it s a bit of a sausage fest. Colbert also mocked the stand-off the armed traitors hoped for but didn t get. Probably not what the protesters had in mind. That s like taking over the Alamo and then not being surrounded by the Mexicans. To conclude, Colbert mocked Bundy and his friends for being less prepared than a troop of boy scouts. What heroic, go-it-alone mountain men have always needed   Go-Gurt, string cheese and Lunchables. I want you to hang in there, fellas, because help is on the way. The refuge should really be renamed the  Ammon Bundy Preserve for the Armed and Cranky,  Colbert suggested.Here s the video via YouTube.Yeah, hang in there, guys. Because the longer you carry on this farce, the more material you give to Stephen Colbert and the rest of the world with which to mock you. Congratulations, you all are officially a worldwide joke.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Bernie Sanders Roasts Donald Trump: ‘I Don’t Have To Spend Money’ To Make Him ‘Look Dumb’ (VIDEO),"On Tuesday s edition of  The Nightly Show, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders promised to steal the White House from Republican front runner Donald Trump if the two should ever face off in the presidential election.On the show, host Larry Wilmore asked Sanders what he thought about Trump s much-reported use of the word  schlong  to insult Hillary Clinton. Sanders, making a joke out of Trump s numerous nonsensical remarks, said: I don t know the answer to that. I have yet to recover from Trump s shock that women go to the bathroom. I m still recovering from that, so  schlonged,  I haven t figured out yet. Wilmore pressed on, asking Sanders if he would  schlong  The Donald if they went head to head for the presidency. Sanders replied,  Let me say, we will beat him badly. How s that? Wilmore also brought up the fact that someone had been writing anti-Trump messages in the sky last weekend, right above the Rose Bowl Parade. Wilmore asked Sanders if he d had anything to do with it, since there had coincidentally been a rally for Sanders at the same time. Sander responded with something we all know to be true: I don t have to spend money to make Donald Trump look dumb   he does it all by himself. You can watch Sanders roast The Donald below: The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveIn later parts of the interview, Sanders took the opportunity to express his support for President Barack Obama s executive action on guns, blasting Republicans for trying to hold back an initiative that was so badly needed in America. We re not getting any cooperation from the Republicans, no matter how many horrific mass shootings we see. I think the most important thing we have to do now is to expand and improve the instant background check. What the president is trying to do now is deal with the so-called gun show loophole. Many of Sanders  constituents in Vermont are responsible gun owners, but Sanders said they accept the dangers that can come with firearms and don t argue that policies must be in place to avoid their misuse. People hunt and they do outdoor things   that s what we do. But the vast majority of the people understand, in my state, and I think around the country, that it s imperative that we do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Criminals (and) people who are mentally unstable should not own a gun. That s my view, and there is a broad consensus around that. Also touching on the Black Lives Matter movement, Sanders and Wilmore agreed that the media has blown controversial issues out of proportion. Sanders said, I think white people are as appalled as African-Americans and Latinos in seeing what we re seeing on television, and that is unarmed people being killed while they re in police custody. The Vermont senator, who has made criminal justice reform a crucial part of his campaign, also stressed that reducing police brutality would be one of his priorities as president: The first, and maybe most, important is to make sure that if a police officer breaks the law, that officer   like any other public official   must be held accountable. Other things that we have to do is demilitarize many of our local police departments. We have to make police departments look like the communities they serve, in terms of diversity. What appalls me is that we have more people in jail today than any other country on Earth   more than China, 2.2 million people   and that s why we need real criminal justice reform. We ve got to make sure that kids have jobs and education, rather than hanging out on street corners unemployed. Featured image is a screenshot, via Raw Story",News,"January 6, 2016"
 @Ammon_Bundy’s Ridiculous Late Night Twitter Rant Has Everyone Talking (TWEETS),"Either Ammon Bundy himself or a clever imposter has taken Twitter   and the media   by storm. The head of the Oregon Moron Militia, Bundy is the textbook case of the modern  Murican  patriot.  He is either just being himself and having a Twitter-fest of spewing out right-wing talking points or someone has decided to channel him, guessing the Bundy-esque things he might say.The rant was late-night, when the cold of the Oregon forest may have demanded a little something to make a person forget what aches. More than a dozen tweets went out from the account, including a retweet of an interview Bundy did with a local blog. Here are a few examples:As Thomas Paine said, It is the duty of the patriot to protect its country from its government. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 5, 2016We are not about fear, we are not about force, we are not about intimidation. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016We came here in protest because of the force and the intimidation that we have seen in this county. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016With that being said, we will not be intimidated by the federal government for taking stand for something we strongly believe in.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016It even went so far as to compare the Moron Militia to Rosa Parks:We are doing the same thing as Rosa Parks did. We are standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016However, reporters now say the account is believed to be a fake. Tony Dokoupil of MSNBC tweeted this:People, Ammon Bundy is not operating a twitter account. I stood with him last night as tweets supposedly from him went out.  tonydokoupil (@tonydokoupil) January 6, 2016That seems to be compelling enough. A reporter who was there at the time says Bundy isn t on Twitter at all. That seemed like the case for sure when the account was suspended by Twitter, which has a process of verifying identities of celebrities and others in the news. Then USA Today reported that the account was suspended and that it was re-instated.Another theory may be that much like many people on Twitter who have become public figures, Ammon Bundy has someone  smarter  than he is running his account. With all the freedoming and interviews he s doing, Bundy probably doesn t have time for the social media onslaught for the movement, which has obviously been even less successful than the movement itself.Alas, the account is still alive and well and as of Wednesday at just after 11 AM EST tweeted this:The last thing we want is an armed confrontation. We want this to end peacefully without anyone being harmed.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016That s the first real evidence that the account may not be real unless Ammon Bundy s goal of remaining for years to give a bird preserve to loggers, miners and ranchers has changed.

 Watch How Absurd A Gun Nut Looks Defending U.S. Gun Violence On A UK TV Show (VIDEO),"Try to picture a place where gun control is real   where people can sit in a coffee shop without worrying that a lunatic is going to start indiscriminately shooting people. Imagine you didn t have to worry about the safety of your children when they got on that school bus. Conjure an image where things are peaceful enough that most of the police don t even carry guns, and when they do they wear big yellow letters that say  armed. Believe it or not, those places do exist. In a far away land called Europe and another called Australia, people have learned that guns don t have to be what defines them and that if a society is to evolve, it must do so peacefully. They ve moved on to bigger and better things while here at home, we dig the hole a little bit deeper.President Obama s executive orders on gun control have put America in the spotlight. People from all over the world want to know if the United States has finally learned its lesson and decided to take action. In the UK, where gun deaths for the year won t reach the number America has had in five days, talking to a Yank who loves guns has to be almost as comical as it is ridiculous.The talking points we listen to every day and have accepted as the right-wing response, sound even more absurd when you hear them spoken to a Brit.

 The Hidden Root Of White Rage,"Paul Krugman asks a simple question about why white (conservative) people who fly into a rage always seem to do so over really stupid things:Something that strikes me, however   and which I don t fully understand   is that when people like this turn to angry rhetoric, with at least a hint of violence, the trigger events tend to be trivial. There are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working-class whites Now, I loves me some Krugman but he s missing the super obvious here: White conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people. It was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did, decade after decade. White people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities. But the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering. Except for the rich, of course.The end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place. What are they going to say?  Hey! Where are all the white jobs?! On top of this frustration is the cold and horrible (for white people) realization that they no longer have total control over the government. With a black president in the White House, there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold. Those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of America, they aren t coming back.This leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives. But to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they, white people, benefited at the expense of black people in the first place. Most white people, including liberals, would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap. And so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage, a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be. It really is that simple.Featured image via AI archives",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Oregon Militia Terrorist: I’ll Die Before I Let The Feds Arrest Me (VIDEO),"The situation with the Bundy ranchers and their heavily armed right-wing militia s occupation of a federal building on a wildlife reserve in Oregon is escalating. The federal government is planning to take steps to end their ridiculous occupation, but at least one of them has said he ll lay down his very life before he allows the authorities to arrest him.The Harvey County Sheriff said of the handling of the militant takeover: There are things being done. It s not visible to the public. Authorities are reportedly taking steps to stop power service to the occupied federal building, as well as working with the FBI and other federal government authorities to have the militia members removed. Of course, the idiots calling themselves the Oath Keepers, had to comment. They told families to relocate their children: This is not a family event. The only people there should be the armed men who are willing to die there with Ammon Bundy and his brothers and a couple of embedded reporters. One of the militiamen spoke with MSNBC about his intentions for when the government closes in on their occupation. LaVoy Finicum, 55, says he knows that agents are coming for him and others occupying the building. However, he seems to believe he ll die first. He said to MSNBC: I have been raised in the country all my life. I love dearly to feel the wind on my face. To see the sun rise, to see the moon. I have no intention of spending any of my days in a concrete box. Well, sir, if you weren t breaking the law, you wouldn t have reason to fear spending time in prison. These idiots need to be arrested. They are nothing more than real life, bona fide terrorists.This guy is so dumb that he sincerely believes that the authorities won t find him because he is hiding under a huge blue tarp in the middle of a vacant parking lot with his penis extension gun.

 Maddow Compares Trump To 1968 Racist Candidate George Wallace: The Similarity Is Shocking (VIDEO),"Some political pundits have been unable to describe how Donald Trump manages to maintain his popularity. With his escalating hateful rhetoric, personal insults, and generally obnoxious behavior, many have settled their confusion by pretending there is no way he can win the Republican primary. The problem with that is, all polls show he can.Rachel Maddow uncovered what seems to be the secret to Trump s success. It appears that he took his complete strategy for how to run a presidential campaign from 1968 s Racist Alabama Governor George Wallace. This explains a lot about how Trump s campaign of disgusting hate has been able to flourish so easily among regressive conservatives in America.If you use a little imagination and think Trump and Muslims, instead of Wallace and African-Americans, the parallels will suddenly become clear. Like Rachel said,  Close your eyes and just listen to the news reports from that election. It s almost like they re talking about Donald Trump. Watch Rachel s presentation comparing Trump and George Wallace below:What Rachel pointed out was incredibly significant. The comparisons are eerie and even if you were to take the direct comparisons of Trump and Wallace out of the picture, the supporters   who you couldn t possibly say were imitating each other intentionally   are virtually identical in the thoughts they convey about why they support their candidate.Rachel finished the segment by making a great point: Donald Trump has something that Republican voters like. They liked it the last time that he offered it to them for a short period of time,  she said.  And now they like it this time, as well   it s the same type of significant popularity. It just hasn t gone away this time around because he hasn t stopped running this time around like he did in 2012. She s right. Trump offered up the same fare in the 2012 presidential campaign and got a huge amount of support from it. If he had chosen to invest himself fully the last time around, he could have taken the nomination from Romney, who was universally panned by the Republican establishment right up until he was their only choice.The question now is: what will happen when Trump ends up on the ballot? A couple years after Wallace was officially in an election, he was shot. Could Trump s hate speech eventually become that kind of liability?Featured image via Youtube",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Republicans Are About To Bailout A Foreign Company That Screwed Over 500K American Consumers,"Do you remember the time that Republicans thought automotive companies should be allowed to go bankrupt? They seem to have forgotten all about that.House Republicans are set to give a big wet kiss to Volkswagen in the form of a bailout that will prevent them from being sued by over 500,00 American consumers, against whom they admitted committing fraud.Volkswagen has been caught up in a huge scandal after it admitted to cheating on air pollution standards. The context behind the scandal and ensuing lawsuits lies with  defeat devices  that VW had installed in approximately 580,000 of their diesel vehicles, in order to fool emissions testing in the U.S.Remember, these are the same Republicans that worked to block a VW plant from opening in Chattanooga, Tennessee because the plant was going to be unionized. This proves they don t really care about Volkswagen. They just really love hurting American citizens.The suit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA could net Volkswagen up to $18 billion in fines. However, that s not all of their problems. The Justice Department also indicated that it could roll individual lawsuits into their litigation as well. The individual lawsuits come from owners that might win up to $6,000 each in compensation for paying more than a gas-powered model costs plus decline in resale value. Add on a potential 3 billion more from consolidated individual cases Whoa! That s a lot of money!What will Volkswagen do? Why, run to Republicans of course.Yes, these are the same Republicans that wanted GM to just go bankrupt when a bailout for them would save jobs. It s clearly a different story when government action helps regular people. For rich, faceless corporations no bailout is too large or too insane   and this bailout is truly insane.The bill, which doesn t actually offer monetary compensation to cover VW s lawsuit costs, will instead make it virtually impossible for a class action suit to be brought against the corporation.From The Fiscal Times:The simplicity of the VW Bailout Bill belies the chaos it would create. Proponents like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the bill s leading lobbyist, say they merely want to get rid of  non-injury  class-action cases, based on potential damages from defective consumer products or corporate actions that have yet to result in harm. Lawyers for class-action litigants argue that defective products deserve compensation even if the consumer hasn t yet been injured.But the bill goes much further, stating that courts may not certify class-action suits unless the plaintiff  affirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative or representatives. This is devastating because it sets up all class-actions to fail,  says attorney Lori Andrus, who represents several Volkswagen plaintiffs. If every class member must have the same type and scope of injury, it forces extensive proofs for class certification   essentially a full-blown trial up front, where plaintiffs will have to prove that their injuries match with their fellow representatives.Source: The Fiscal TimesTo put it simply, this isn t only for Volkswagen. This is a good straw-man case that Republicans can use to do something they have wanted to do for decades:  shut the door to justice on American consumers that get screwed over by corporations. It would allow for rampant abuse of the system, resulting in sub-standard products being sold, with little to no recourse available to consumers ever. Additionally, it would overturn decades of judicial precedent where corporations were held accountable for fraud while circumventing federal rules that lay out class action standards.As an extra insult, Republicans are pairing the bill with the FACT Act, which would force public reporting of personal information of asbestos victims, in an effort to sabotage their compensation for poisoning. It s incredibly inappropriate for Congress to send the message that it s OK to hurt people by the millions,  said Rebecca Kaplan   a Volkswagen owner.  The more people you hurt, the more this law will protect you. Featured image via screen capture from YouTube",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Donald Trump Cracks Jokes After His Supporter Calls President Obama ‘A Muslim’ (VIDEO),"Here we go, again.Another supporter of Donald Trump openly shouted at a Trump rally held in New Hampshire on Tuesday that President Obama was a Muslim.

Who was the man that said that? I have to reprimand. How dare you. Okay, I reprimanded him. I reprimanded him, now the press can t be angry. Is anyone surprised? We re not. Trump has become such a joke that we re tired of even using the word  joke.  It s long played out   so is the media. Even when he shows a penchant for hateful rhetoric, all the media can do is laugh about it. The shock factor is over. And, the thing is, there was nothing funny about this.All CNN and crew could do when announcing this latest B.S. was to smile. Below is an actual pic taken in context showing what they thought of this latest incident. It s like we re all in some twisted, twilight zone waiting for the rapture. For more on this, visit HERE. See for yourself.Pic via CNN.The truth is hate sells. Trump takes care of the media, and they scratch his back in return. Trump didn t lie when he said he was good for business   cheap reality TV. and political theater, calling the president a Muslim, it s all good for shits and giggles. And, frankly, this writer is tired of it.The real truth is, Trump wouldn t go after his supporters for being racist even if he wanted to. That s because, the majority of his supporters are racist. He can t alienate his base. According to a major poll done, a full 66% of his supporters think Obama is a Muslim. That s pretty insane. Maybe that s why CNN is laughing. They still can t believe this is still actually happening, either.",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Montel Williams SHAMES The NRA: Responsible Gun Owners Support Background Checks,"Talk show legend Montel Williams is a conservative, one who has expressed very critical opinions of Barack Obama in the past. But Williams says there s an area where he can t disagree with  the President   Obama s plan to use his executive powers to help alleviate a problem most of his fellow conservatives won t touch.On Tuesday, the President broke into tears as he discussed the problem of gun violence in America today   specifically, the lives lost in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, which Obama calls the  worst day in [his] presidency.  Obama has pledged to close the  gun show loophole,  which has traditionally allowed pretty damn near everyone to circumvent the background check procedure and get themselves a shootin  stick with minimal hassle. In addition, the President will be removing legal barriers preventing a doctor from reporting when someone is too crazy to have a gun, strengthening licensing requirements for sellers, and making dealers responsible for reporting guns that go missing.While many conservatives, including the veritable Brady Bunch of ignorance that is the GOP 2016 presidential field, view these common sense steps as an attack on the freedom of every single man, woman, and child, Williams applauds the President s approach to the problem of gun violence today.  I PROUDLY own 14 guns RESPONSIBLY,  Williams wrote on Facebook.  Naturally, I listened closely to what President Obama said today on guns, and I ve read what was put out detailing his proposals. He explained that no truly responsible gun owner should oppose the President s plans to reform gun laws, nor should any of them develop the opinion that the President and his jack-booted thugs will be going door to door taking people s firearms from them. I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill,  he says.  That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams added in a comment.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. In an op-ed for HuffPo, Williams says that  as a proud, responsible, gun owner,  he  can t NOT support  the President s proposal: I realize this may not make me popular with some gun owners, and I realize there is deep distrust of President Obama and his use of executive action. Simply put, I ve always believed in being a responsible ambassador for the Second Amendment, a right that I hold dear; and, thus, I believe responsible gun owners MUST be the loudest voices for universal background checks and addressing the mental health crisis we face in this country, which form the crux of the president s proposals. Williams says that he has formed his views largely through his work with students  in the wake of school shootings over the years.  Williams challenges anyone who disagrees that it is important to enact common sense gun legislation to spend time with children who have survived school shootings: They all have the same, haunted look in their eyes, one that frequently keeps me up at night. I would challenge anyone to listen to their stories, experience their pain and then go back the next year and the next, and see how profoundly they are affected and then do it all over again for the next school   you ll feel the same way I do. Universal background checks should be a no-brainer. Guns should not change hands without a background check,  he says.  I cannot give my car to my children without filing a form with the DMV, and no one complains about that burden, nor do they suggest it s a veiled attempt to de-car America. Unfortunately, the NRA and its acolytes spread fear   Obama wants your guns   to all who will listen, and unfortunately too many listen. The NRA and its bought-and-paid-for politicians fight progress with regard to gun legislation every step of the way   including, of course, background checks. Giving up even that much, in their eyes, would be giving up their guns.Williams suggests that we dispense with the meaningless rhetoric, cross the aisle, and work together to solve the problem of gun violence in this country   the root of which, he  says, is that it s  dangerous allowing people to acquire guns without a background check. Williams says that both liberals and conservatives need to skip the divisiveness that plagues our country and focus on the fact that our children s lives are at stake. He asks his fellow gun owners not to buy into the extreme Right s propaganda that paints this as a gun-grabbing measure: This is common sense, and, ultimately, the best way to advance and protect the Second Amendment right we hold dear. Williams is right. No one is trying to take anyone s guns. In fact, President Obama is attempting to ensure that everyone who should be able to get a gun can get one. In the end, this would even accomplish some conservative goals: people would feel safer around armed individuals if they all passed a comprehensive background check and were mentally competent to handle the weapon, for instance. In that sense, the President s plan is a godsend for pro-Second Amendment people of all stripes. If conservatives want to end the stigma associated with gun ownership, the absolute best way is to support this opportunity to protect the integrity of the Second Amendment.Featured image via Facebook/screengrab ",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Bill O’Reilly Plays Stump The Trump On Foreign Policy And Makes Him Look Like A Fool (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran?  O Reilly asked.  Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia,  Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric.  I would want to protect Saudi Arabia,  Trump claimed.  But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016"
 Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz,"Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 6, 2016"
 WATCH: Ted Cruz Pushes Birther’s Bizarre Star Wars Video Supporting His Presidential Run,"Ted Cruz is promoting the work of a birther filmmaker who has created a bizarre YouTube video that casts the right-wing Texas senator as the hero of the Star Wars movies. Cruz s campaign pushed a link featuring the video in a blast email to supporters: In honor of the latest Star Wars movie, the team here at Cruz HQ wanted to share with you a YouTube video created by a fellow supporter that depicts Senator Cruz as a Jedi Warrior, fighting for the Constitution,  the Cruz campaign wrote in an email to supporters last night, linking to a fawning Breitbart article about the video.The video shows Cruz riding an elephant with a lightsaber made out of the U.S. Constitution moving from state to state, flipping them from Democratic blue to Republican red. The video ends with Cruz confronting President Obama flanked by a phalanx of RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) and restoring liberty.The film was created by birther filmmaker Joel Gilbert, who produced the anti-Obama propaganda film Dreams from My Real Father. In that film, Gilbert indulges in the conspiracy theory that Obama s father was Communist Frank Marshall Davis. The video also uses fake images to smear President Obama s mother, claiming that she posed for sexual photos.Gilbert also claims that Obama has had plastic surgery so that his nose no longer resembles Davis. Gilbert also alleges that the president is secretly a Muslim, despite the ample evidence that he is a practicing Christian, and claims that the 2012 presidential election was stolen. He writes columns for World Net Daily, a leading pro-birther conspiracy website affiliated with Donald Trump.Pushing the video is just the latest example of Cruz s significant habit of stroking his own ego, often indulging in hyperbolic speech to cast himself and his campaign as central figures in a hero/persecution myth.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 6, 2016"
" Jennifer Lawrence: When You Attack Planned Parenthood, You’re Attacking All Women","Jennifer Lawrence has been speaking her mind lately. In an interview with GLAMOUR, the Academy Award-winning actress went no-holds-barred on a lot of issues, including the recent attacks on Planned Parenthood. She said: It s so awful. It isn t an attack on abortions; it s an attack on women. Because Planned Parenthood is so much more [than abortion]. My mom was really religious with me when I was young. She s not so much anymore. And I wouldn t have been able to get birth control if it weren t for [Planned Parenthood]. I wouldn t have been able to get condoms and birth control and all these things I needed as a normal teenager who was growing up in a Jesus house. Lawrence was referring to the November attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, when Robert Lewis Dear killed three people and wounded nine. Planned Parenthood, which delivers sex education and reproductive health care to women, has faced attacks before. There have been three attacks since September after an anti-abortion group accused Planned Parenthood of selling baby parts. The flames were fanned by Republicans, including presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who said: They were certainly caught on film, that there is no doubt that they were selling baby parts. That is unambiguous. The videos show senior Planned Parenthood officials selling the parts of unborn children, and it is a federal criminal offense. It s a felony to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That accusation has proven to be false, but the damage done when a public figure makes such statements is enormous, similar to Trump s verbal attacks on Islam, which has caused a spike in attacks on Muslims across the United States. Lawrence s feelings about the Republican party are already documented: I was raised a Republican, but I just can t imagine supporting a party that doesn t support women s basic rights. Lawrence believes that Planned Parenthood provides important services to women, and she was horrified by the recent attacks. She said: I am a successful woman who has not had a pregnancy . [Laughs] But seriously. What harm comes from supplying people with birth control, condoms, Pap smears, and cancer screenings? She s right. Planned Parenthood provides services to women that they wouldn t have access to otherwise. A recent study shows: For the millions of poor women who depend on Planned Parenthood clinics, this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Later in the interview, Lawrence was asked why she decided to take a stand on major issues. She said: I keep going back and forth on being opinionated  My business is based on everybody buying tickets and seeing my movie. It s not smart, business-wise, to be opinionated. But then what s the point in having a voice at all if I m not going to use it for what I truly believe in?

 FL Toddler Shoots Himself In The Face After ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Leaves Weapon In Truck (VIDEO),"A Florida two-year-old is in critical condition after he shot himself in the face Monday night while playing with his  responsible  gun-owning  grandfather s unattended gun. WFTV reports that the unnamed child was riding in his grandfather s pickup truck when grandpa parked and ran inside the family s home, leaving the little boy to his own devices. Grandpa, whose name has not been released, also left his gun behind   because what s the point in being irresponsible if you re not going to go all-out?The grandfather says he left the little boy playing with some tools in the back seat, but the child managed to climb into the front of the truck, where Granddaddy kept his .32-caliber Kel-Tec gun. The gun was  responsibly  kept in a holster, but the child removed it and shot himself in the cheek, near his eye. The boy was airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, where he remains in critical condition. They are talking to individuals that were at the residence, possibly in the residence and we have forensics out gathering some evidence,  said Twis Lizasuain, Osceola County Sheriff s Office media relations director, who noted that evidence thus far suggests the discharge was  accidental    a word we too often hear when one of the  good guys with guns  shoots a child or, through negligence, allows a child to shoot him or herself. We will always encourage you to secure a weapon, especially when children are present. Though the shooting will likely be called  accidental,  grandpa might not escape unscathed. He could still be charged under a law that allows an irresponsible person to be held accountable if a child gets ahold of a gun that was not properly stored out of reach.Watch a report on this latest example of why guns make it into far too many hands than needed, below:Featured image via NLM",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Rush Limbaugh Squirms And Stammers As A Caller Debunks His LIES About Guns And Obama (VIDEO),"Just about every day, Rush Limbaugh s big fat lies are systematically exposed and debunked online by a variety of sources, and it never stops being awesome. But when it comes from one of his own dittoheads   and on his own show, no less   it s especially entertaining. Not only is it fun to hear callers stick it to him, it s even more fun to watch Limbaugh squirm and pluck his chest, desperately struggling to wiggle out of the call.Such was the case on Tuesday following President Obama s executive order to expand background checks and to provide additional funding for mental health treatment and new resources for the FBI and the ATF.During the January 5 edition of his radio show, Limbaugh was ranting about something he yanked out of his diseased bunghole, suggesting that Obama s executive order forces patients to tell their doctors where they re storing their firearms and ammo. Of course, this is total hooey, and Limbaugh would ve continued to elaborate on his lie if it hadn t been for an industrious and  pro-gun  caller who totally undermined Limbaugh s entire rant with the, you know, facts.Hashtag flop-sweat.The caller noted that there are, in fact, state-level statutes in place already that mandate doctors to ask mental health patients if they believe they re a danger to themselves, but there s nothing in either state law or Obamacare or in Obama s executive order demanding that doctors known where patients are hiding their weapons. Nothing. It doesn t exist. Limbaugh made it up.Via Media Matters:CALLER: [Y]ou re telling a half-truth, at least for my state   a half-truth for my state. You need to get the information from the pamphlets that were sent out to health professionals at that time for each state. And we weren t   it does not say you ask where the gun is. It asks sensible things like  are you going to hurt yourself?  If they are, of course, stupid enough to say yes, you re, you know   do you have access to ways   are you planning on hurting someone else? But nothing on that says that I have to ask him,  Where is your gun?  and so forth. I got that information and that was from my state, not from Obama. That was from my state, and I know federal trickles down to state, but I take a little issue with some of your blanket statements when most of it was common sense prior to that, but it is state statute in Illinois a long time ago that if, say grandma has dementia and she lives with you, that you have a certain way to store that, and that s just called gun responsibility.Limbaugh stammered and tried desperately to dodge the truth. The caller, meanwhile, kept hammering away, noting that it s perfectly acceptable to, for instance, call the police if we think someone in our household is a danger to him or herself. The caller refers to this action as a  civic responsibility. Needless to say, Limbaugh s call-screener will likely be spending the New Year looking for a new job.By the way, you have to listen to the audio of the call just to hear Limbaugh completely choking on the truth.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 5, 2016"
 40 Million Bad*ss Birders Just Declared War On Oregon Terrorists,"According to an open letter addressed to the  Oregon Terrorists,  there are some 40 million nature photographers and bird lovers in the United States, and they re pissed.The letter, written by a wildlife tracker and nature photographer named Kevin, warns the militants who are currently holed up in Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that  no small group of armed thugs is going to destroy the great wildlife and national park system that our great Republican President Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir put in place over a century ago. Writing under the name Norwegian Chief, the author states that the entire birding community is up-in-arms over what is going on in Oregon:We are watching your every move, and we have been watching you for a long time. And yes absolutely you are domestic terrorists of the worst kind, and the truth about your decades of constant poaching of protected wildlife around Malheur and other wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests and BLM lands has been well-documented. For years those of us who are wildlife photographers, birdwatchers and carers of wildlife, have been documenting the activities of you poachers and criminals around many of our nation s wildlife refuges.He goes on to remind the armed thugs that it is people like himself who have brought many criminals like them to justice over the years:With our powerful cameras, and ability to move unseen in the wilderness, we have found and documented your illegal hunts, your illegal traps and all sorts of illicit activities, and are constantly feeding that information to law enforcement, and we have finally got many of you poachers on the run and into jails.Just to make sure that the terrorists understand that these folks mean business, the author describes in glorious detail, exactly why they should:Those of us who are international wildlife and nature photographers regularly face charging elephants, attacking lions and grizzlies, hidden crocodiles, massive storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, the hottest, coldest and windiest conditions, and all kinds of poisonous snakes and bugs in our work, and we know the outdoors and wilderness from desert to jungle to sea to mountain to tundra from pole to equator better then any poacher or criminal or yeehaw yokel ever will, and we are not afraid to protect it. We have a just fear of nature from experience, but we don t fear you gun-toting thugs in the least.These are people who are likely to be far more familiar with the local terrain than the armed lunatics who seized the wildlife refuge. They re people who have spent countless hours hiking those trails, getting to know every nook and cranny of the wilderness. They re also people who have the kind of patience it takes to remain totally still for long periods of time, and to mask their presence so that not even a wild animal can detect it.Kevin writes:You will never see us, but we and our cameras will always see you. We will #takebackmalheur from you terrorists, and will not rest until every one of you thugs and poachers is behind bars where they belong.As Addicting Info reported here, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major source of revenue for local businesses.According to the letter, the birding network is watching every move made by these terrorists. They know who goes in and out, who is taking supplies and who is supporting this armed and illegal occupation. According to Kevin, someone from a nearby trailer park isn t going to like the consequences of their recent actions.We know the nearby trailer park, who is supplying you with food, and a tourist boycott of them is already in the works for all birders for this upcoming bird season. We know who everyone is coming in and out, and why, and every shred of information is going straight to law enforcement and across every birding network in America.He writes that he, and others like him are: sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife. Malheur, Hart Mountain, Klamath Marsh, Yellowstone, Glacier, Yosemite etc etc, they all belong to us, we the American people. In closing, Kevin says this:We stand now and forever with wildlife, and you seditionists and terrorists are about to find out that s there is a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out and poach innocent animals, will never be able to outrun or hide from.We are watching you and our years of birding photography have made us endlessly patient and determined.I must admit, I never really thought of birders as being all that badass.I definitely do now.I have no doubt that if there was ever a head-to-head battle between these birders and the yokels who are currently occupying the Malheur wildlife refuge, these birders would kick YallQueda ass all the way back to the scum-filled swamp they crawled out of.Read the entire letter from Norwegian Chief here, via Daily Kos.*Featured image credit: Pixabay",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Ted Cruz Goes FULL Right-Wing Lunatic Trying To Raise Support Off Obama’s Gun Actions (IMAGES),"As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures, and as all the right-wing lunatics of the Republican party seem to be drifting towards Donald Trump, Ted Cruz knew what he had to do   go full right-wing lunatic himself.After President Obama announced his common sense executive actions for gun reform and a safer America, many Republicans were outraged. After all, fewer guns in the hands of the mentally ill means fewer massacres, which in turns means people won t be as scared and in turn go out and buy stockpiles of unnecessary firearms. Republicans, bought and paid for by the gun lobby, want to make sure people stay scared and have as many guns as possible.Well, Senator Ted Cruz, doing all he can to fear-monger his base of voters too stupid to realize they re being manipulated, decided he would have some fun with photoshop and scare people into supporting him. He sent out this to entice people:via tedcruz.orgOr from a mobile device: via tedcruz.orgMind you, President Obama said nothing of taking guns from anyone, or wanting anyone s guns. He s done nothing to, in any way, go against the Second Amendment which calls for citizens to be well regulated. Obama is simply trying to make sure existing laws are followed and the wrong people don t have access to buy firearms.Now, unless these right-wingers are terrified that they are going to be labeled the ones who are mentally ill, none of this effects them whatsoever. In fact, it strengthens the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners.However, Cruz, knowing his supporters are paranoid idiots, is preying on this fear for support and sends them an image of a militarized President Obama with the very false and simplistic phrase,  OBAMA WANTS YOUR GUNS,  perfectly catering to the fear these simple-minded, myopic voters have.We could say,  shame on you  to Ted Cruz for doing this, but to his credit, this sort of fear-mongering, albeit utterly inaccurate and unethical, works for Republican politicians. They have perfectly wrapped up the terrified conspiracy theorist vote, and this imagery play perfectly into that narrative.That being said, shame on you, Cruz. This is just pathetic.Featured image: tedcruz.org/flickr",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Fox Host Claims Obama Used A ‘Raw Onion’ To Fake Cry Over Murdered School Children (VIDEO),"Anyone who watched Barack Obama break into tears as he spoke of the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary can tell that the President is a man who truly feels for the victims of gun violence   anyone, that is, who doesn t work for Fox News.After the President s announcement that he would be doing what Congress is unwilling to do   expanding background check and gun safety regulations, including closing the  gun show loophole  (all sensible measures)   the hosts of Outnumbered pounced on the President s plan, arguing that he was violating the separation of powers doctrine. What really bothered them, however, was the idea that a human being is capable of showing emotion that is not fake. And so begins Onionghazi, brought to you by our friends at Fox News. What was really upsetting was the tears that he wiped away again and again,  Melissa Francis said.  You want that for   I mean, we feel frightened about what s going on with ISIS. And he can t pull that kind of passion for anything about this.  She added that she feels  bad about those kids  in Newtown, but claimed it s  only about this that he gets so upset about. After a commercial break, Andrea  Tantaros jumped into the fray, arguing that President Obama s tears must be fake because  he would have spoken out a long time ago  if he really cared   especially in favorite conservative talking point, Chicago: This is how many years? Almost eight years, he s almost at the end of his term, and you haven t heard him go to Chicago and really speak out about this issue. And he is uniquely poised to do so. But everything that he s doing will not solve the problem.So, I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears. It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. It just didn t seem horribly authentic,  Meghan McCain agreed.  And maybe it is, I don t know him at all.  In any case, she thinks the President should go to Chicago instead of  talking about God-fearing Americans when ISIS is coming to their hometown and shooting up 14 people. They say he s just cool, that s the way he is, that he doesn t get emotional,  Francis chimed in.  We haven t seen this in a very long time and it s about something that feels political, that feels somewhat insincere, that feels like it s not going to make a huge difference. It s like bad political theater,  McCain opined.It s something that was to be expected: President Obama showed compassion for murdered children, so the Right has assumed what they feel is a duty to for some reason attempt to convince people that he is not sincere   an act that is shameful at best.Watch it below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIvAgKrq4tc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016"
" Cops Take Care Of ‘Chronic Problem’–Kill Unarmed, Disabled Black Man (VIDEO)","Kevin Matthews, a 35-year-old Black man from Detroit, Michigan, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Even so, Matthews had never committed a felony offense in his life.On December 23, a Dearborn police officer shot Matthews multiple times, ending his life. Two days later, the coroner ruled his death a homicide.Since the shooting, police have made every attempt to make it appear that Matthews was a hardened criminal. During an interview with the press, Detroit Police Chief James Craig claimed that Matthews had  a crime problem. During an interview with WXYZ, Police Chief Craig also called him a  chronic problem in this area. In case we need more proof that cops believe they have a right to act as judge, jury and executioner, police have repeatedly stated that Matthews committed larceny earlier in the day. Note that the words  accused of larceny  or  suspected of larceny  aren t used in association with this officer-involved shooting. Instead, with their words, Detroit and Dearborn police make it clear that they ve assumed the role of the courts; trying, convicting and sentencing Matthews all on their own, without the aid of a bothersome justice system.Police have not provided any evidence that a larceny took place, or that Matthews was implicated as the suspect.Police state that Matthews was wanted on a misdemeanor probation violation, and that the officer recognized him from the earlier larceny.Voice of Detroit did a thorough records search and found that no such warrant exists.The search showed that the 35-year-old man had one misdemeanor conviction in 2013, and no other convictions.Dearborn police chief Ronald Haddad wants the public to know that he stands by the officer who shot Matthews. And in the very same sentence he said there will be a  full investigation  into the shooting. I stand behind the officer, and we re going to have a full investigation with Detroit police. It should go without saying that an impartial investigation cannot begin with a biased premise.Many details about what happened that day are not available. It appears that an unidentified Dearborn police officer spotted Matthews walking on the sidewalk at the border of Detroit and Dearborn. The Dearborn officer placed a call to dispatch stating that he was  approaching one on foot. Three minutes later the officer placed a  shots fired  call.It is clear that the officer crossed the boundary between Detroit and Dearborn to  approach  Matthews.They claim that Matthews fled on foot into a nearby backyard. Police also claim that a struggle ensued and that Matthews reached for the officers gun. This is why he was shot at least six times.According to family members, Matthews was disabled. Aside from being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, a recent car accident had left one of his arms virtually unusable. Voice of Detroit reports that a cast had just been removed from his arm, and that his fingers  remained clenched up. The officer, who is described as a white male with five years on the force, pursued Matthews out of his own jurisdiction, and away from the area where his vehicle s dashcam would record what took place. Police have not stated whether there is any video or audio evidence in this case.Social justice advocates are calling for an independent investigation into the shooting.Detroit police commissioner, Ricardo Moore, also called for an independent investigation into the shooting. Moore expressed concern about Police Chief Craig s statements to the press, criticizing him for  escalating tensions in the community,  rather than increasing public trust. Because of   Craig s biased statement against the deceased suspect, this situation would warrant an independent investigation from the Michigan State Police, solely. Craig should be trying to give the public trust in this investigation, as opposed to creating tension between the community and the police. Both Craig and Dearborn police chief Haddad have worked hard to demonize Matthews in the press. Although he has no felony criminal record, both the Detroit and Dearborn police chiefs want the public to believe that Matthews had a  crime problem. According to Reverend Charles Williams II, chair of the National Action Network (NAN) Matthews was both well-loved and well-respected in the community, in spite of the challenges he faced. He was one of those folks in the community who was definitely a respected person. Not only did they know him well, they knew his challenges well. Police officers on the Detroit side knew him also. When they saw him wandering, they would give him a ride to his mother s house. It is concerning to me that the officer claimed he felt threatened. Not only did Kevin have a broken arm, but he was a very small guy. Here s more on the story from WXYZ.*Featured image credit: video screen capture WXYZ",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Hero Activist Corners ‘Full Of Sh*t’ Ben Carson For Saying Homosexuality Is A Choice (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was confronted by an LGBT activist on Monday evening about the retired neurosurgeon s previous remarks that gay people have made the choice to be gay   and luckily the awkward encounter was recorded on camera and posted by ABC News.Carson had been meeting with supporters at a town hall meeting in Staten Island. As he posed for pictures, a woman wearing a Pride Center of Staten Island t-shirt approached him and said she wanted to ask him a question. She said: I have a quick question. Do you think I chose to be gay? Carson was taken completely off guard and repeated her question back to her, avoiding a clear answer as many others looked on. He replied, Did you choose to be gay? That s a long conversation. Fully aware that the answer really wasn t that complicated, the activist walked away   but not before telling Carson, I think you re full of sh*t. You can watch the Carson squirm in the footage below:WATCH: @realBenCarson confronted at Staten Island town hall:  Do you think I chose to be gay?  https://t.co/gL3N7TXpO1  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 5, 2016Like many of his fellow Republicans, Carson s rhetoric is plagued by anti-gay remarks. Carson clearly expressed his stance on whether or not he felt homosexuality was a choice when he spoke to CNN s Chris Cuomo in March. Cuomo had asked Carson what his opinion was on the matter and Carson s unwavering response was: Absolutely. Because a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out they re gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question. Carson has said plenty of other equally ridiculous things about the LGBT community as well. In the past, he s likened homosexuals to pedophiles and those who engage in bestiality, and claimed that God thinks being gay is an  abomination.  And despite all his anti-LGBT comments and attempts to make sure that the LGBT community doesn t get the same rights as heterosexuals, Carson still has the nerve to say gay people are more protected than Christians.Featured image video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016"
 This Insane GOP Congressman WANTS The Mentally Ill To Have Guns (TWEET),"For years now, sane-minded individuals in Congress alongside President Obama have tried to enact common sense gun reform. And now, where those in Congress have failed to act, the president is doing what he can to tighten up existing gun laws and make sure those who shouldn t have guns don t get them.With Obama s bold actions to curb the epidemic of gun violence comes very open dissent from several members of Congress. They ve chosen to side with insanity and the gun lobby over common sense.One member of Congress, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) decided to opt so far away from common sense, that he tweeted this regarding President Obama s actions: Under Obama s executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. Under Obama's executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. https://t.co/MOEAmQdgDa  John Fleming (@RepFleming) January 5, 2016Now, any human being with even the slightest bit of common sense would agree that doctors better damn well be reporting mentally ill patients to the FBI.Furthermore, the disclosure to the FBI from doctors restricts any form of revealing what a diagnosis would be, so privacy is still protected while safety concerns still reached. Starting next month, no legal repercussions can effect the doctors doing their due diligence. The new rule states: The disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for NICS purposes. Chief executive of the mental health rights advocate Mental Health America, Paul Gionfriddo, even stated: That could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it, and they didn t. The administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group. All of this begs the question, who would be against such measures? And clearly Rep. Fleming raised his hand in enthusiastic agreement that doctors should keep their mouths shut and the mentally ill should have easy access to firearms.This goes directly against the NRA and right-wing aphorism that it s not the gun, it s the person. However, if you re against keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, then you aren t following through with that logic, and now Rep. Fleming can forevermore be labeled a dangerous hypocrite.Thank goodness President Obama is in power and is taking action when Congress refuses to do their job. It is the job of those who represent us to act in our best interest. However, so many choose to act in the best interest of those lining their pockets with lobbying dollars, and in this case, it s the gun lobby.Shame on you, Rep. Fleming.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 5, 2016"
 NRA Thugs Threaten Lawmakers With Bullets For Sponsoring Bill Limiting Purchase Of Ammo (IMAGE),"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 5, 2016"
 President Obama Brought To Tears In Emotional Speech About Needing Smarter Gun Laws (VIDEO),"President Obama could not hold back the tears while discussing the excessive amount of lives lost over the years at the hands of guns during his press conference on Tuesday. In what is perhaps one of his most emotional speeches in recent memory, President Obama asked the nation to start having a  sense of urgency  to finally get rid of gun violence, once and for all.Now, every time the president speaks, the nation notices. This time, however, the president practically cried on live TV. It wasn t the type of crying a baby would do, but rather the sort of emotional embrace you would expect a strong leader to show talking about an issue as critical as this one.With that said, actions speak louder than words   and even tears. That is why the president not only gave a great speech but announced what his new executive actions on gun control would entail. The gun lobby might be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot be holding America hostage. Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40%. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked. 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns from one website had a criminal record. This is not a plot to take away everybody s guns We can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. People are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do. No longer suffice. That s why we re here today. Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Restaurant Owner OBLITERATES Customer Who Said Woman’s Death Ruined Her New Year’s (IMAGES),"Working in the service industry can really be a test, as you will eventually and inevitably come in contact with an impossibly difficult, insensitive customer that makes you question your faith in humanity. And if you haven t worked in the service industry, this story about a customer named Holly Jones will give you a pretty good idea of what a complete nightmare of a customer looks like.For New Year s Eve, Jones visited Kilroy s Bar N Grill in Indianapolis, Indiana   an experience that left her less than satisfied. Jones said that she and her party s experience was  ruined  due to the fact that she had to witness a dead person be wheeled out from an overdose.  And of course, because of this  dead person,  her table didn t get the attention she felt entitled to. Jones was so upset, that she took to Kilroy s Facebook page to blast the restaurant for making her holiday celebration so awful. She wrote: I will never go back to this location for New Year s Eve!!! After the way we were treated when we spent 700+ and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined!!! Every year we have come to Kilroys to enjoy New Years Eve and tonight we were screamed at and had the manager walk away from use while (we) were trying to figure out our bill being messed up.The manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn t matter, but I guess allowing a Junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money!! Our waitress when we were trying to ask about our bill being messed up also said  what do you want me to do (expletive) pay your bill for you?  What a great way to talk to a paying customer! I get that working on New Years Eve (is) stressful but being a complete (expletive) to us all night knowing you get an automatic gratuity is not right!!! Kilroy sJones  bad review is awful enough, but it was Kilroy s response that made this incident gain widespread media attention. Kilroy manager Chris Burton replied to Jones and kindly informed her that the  dead person  who was  wheeled out from an overdose  was actually a 70-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack while she was also celebrating NYE with her family. For Jones  insensitive remarks, Chris offered some harsh words of his own in return. First of all, the  overdosing junkie  that you speak of was a 70-year-old woman who had a heart attack. Thankfully she was revived at the hospital and survived. It sounds like you were very concerned about her so I thought you should know. This poor lady, who was celebrating New Year s Eve with her husband and son, had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her. You can read Burton s full post in the screenshots below, as he closed his post with I m glad to hear you won t be coming back to Kilroy s because we wouldn t want anyone as cold-hearted and nasty as you returning. Kilroy sKilroy sAfter Burton masterfully put Jones in her place, the incident went viral. In another post, Kilroy s reported that the victim who suffered a heart attack was stable, but still had a long way to recover. The bar set up a GoFundMe page, allowing supporters to donate in support of her recovery. The goal of the page was $5,000, but the donations have exceeded twice that amount. If there was one good thing that came out of Jones  nasty attitude and review, it was this   as one donor pointed out: I wonder if the lady who was upset realizes that her negativity has been a major blessing to this family .her anger and the subsequent comment from Kilroy s has lead to people learning about this gofundme and supporting this family. You are almost at the amount you requested in 17 hours. Without that woman, this incident could have happened all too quietly. Featured image via Google and Screenshots",News,"January 5, 2016"
 The Pathetic List Of Supplies The Oregon ‘Patriots’ Brought With Them To Last The Winter,"To the modern conservative  revolutionary,  the men dubbing themselves the Citizens For Constitutional Freedom   aka the morons who have laid siege to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere   may appear to be a well-organized militia worthy of the name. To normal people, they are a group of radicalized right-wing extremists who have taken up arms against their government in the commission of a felony on taxpayer-owned land.Nothing could possibly prove this point more effectively than the statement made by Ammon Bundy himself that his movement would be there for years if necessary coupled with the desperate plea for snacks we heard Monday after only 3 days in the woods.That s not even close to the best part. The Bundy militia allowed The Guardian to photograph their  storeroom,  which looks more like a pile of stuff ready to be tossed in the trunk for a weekend camping trip:Courtesy of The GuardianRemember that this stash is not just supposed to keep the 12-15 people there fed during the revolt, but also provided sustenance for anyone who shows up armed and ready to die for no good reason. The Guardian did an actual inventory of the items in the room:It included a cardboard box of apples and oranges, a few dozen pots of instant ramen, 24 cans of chicken noodle soup, a similar number of cans of sweetcorn, peas, beans and chili, and 20 boxes of macaroni and cheese.There were also three sacks of potatoes, one bag of flour, another of rolled oats, boxes of raisins, a single bag of pretzels and one granola bar.Not very impressive. Fish and Wildlife Services, the agency that runs the wild bird reserve the militia is intent on giving to ranchers, miners and loggers, is planning on shutting down the power to the building, which will leave the criminal trespassers in the cold of the Oregon forest.They say they re prepared, but shutting the power down is just the first step. The FBI is reportedly working on its own plan to shut off any and all access to the outside world to flush out the armed insurrectionists.Hopefully, when the federal government does show up, the imbeciles will throw down their weapons and surrender. It s not like they have a lot of food to survive on.Featured image via The Guardian",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Good ‘Christian’ Bristol Palin Responds To ‘Babygate’ Accusation With EXTREME Profanity And Guns (IMAGES),"In case you haven t heard, there s a theory going around that Bristol Palin s baby was actually born in November. but the family held out on the announcement until Christmas Eve. With a pile of circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that Bristol was impregnated during a Vegas romp with a known Alaskan  adult industry worker  on or around Valentine s Day 2015, The blog Right Wing Crooks broke a very compelling story.Bristol, good  Christian  spokesperson that she is, responded to her critics in a less than Christly way. Using her Instagram screen name,  bsmp2,  she first offered a denial, worded strongly enough that people would take notice:OK, well that solves that then, right? Wrong. If there is no truth to the story the Palins could avoid the internet shitstorm headed their way and comply with one request:Well now we sound like Donald Trump and the birthers of 2008, don t we? Not really, since nobody really cares when Bristol Palin had her baby or who the father is. Things like this are the left s form of divine justice. Every so often karma swings at people like the Palins who preach how much better they are because they love God and America, building fake reputations off of some purity that doesn t exist.Where Bristol is concerned, it s almost too much to handle. While pregnant with her second child out of wedlock she was defending her position as an abstinence counselor. To find out she got knocked up during a one night stand in Vegas wouldn t change any elections, it wouldn t alter the course of human history, and the Palins would still manage to somehow stay relevant because people love stupidity. It would, however, be absolutely hilarious, especially if the whole thing comes tumbling down over a piece of tape.Bristol has already had enough, not bothering to indulge the question or deny it further. She simply abandons her own decency with this:Whoa. Pretty strong. Is Bristol sending a message that she won t engage in questions about it all, or is this all a part of the ruse? Making it seem ludicrous and blowing it off would be much easier than releasing a birth certificate or time-stamped images.Since the story was released Bristol has had little to say. She has been posting, however. Is this maybe another message to people who would question the abstinence princess and her 2 illegitimate children? Let s hope not:Guns, guns and more guns! It seems like someone may be using all of the grains of powder at her disposal to deal with some anger issues.This is the legacy of Bristol Palin. Teenage girl who should have just hidden behind her couch during her idiotic mother s run for the Vice Presidency turned 25-year-old woman whose only accomplishment is a high placement on Dancing With The Stars that she didn t deserve.Nobody really cares, Bristol. If you had your baby to cover up slutty behavior just admit it. If not, then well   good for you.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Trevor Noah Compares Texans Excited About Open Carry Law To Gay Pride Parade Celebrators (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah compared the excitement of the people of Texas over the new open-carry law to men celebrating their homosexuality at a gay pride parade. Texans already could carry hand guns but had to conceal their weapons. Now they could simply be open about it.He said: You see, gun lovers in Texas they just want to stop hiding who they really are. Although it is a little odd how as soon as people got this right they immediately went out into the streets. They were just running like yah! Ooh now I m gonna bring my gun everywhere! We re in the streets! Let s go shopping and at the laundry-mat and hey I m late at my shift at the coffee shop! He then went on to compare the excitement of gun owners over the new law to a gay pride parade: You know what, a little exuberance is fine but what made this weird for me is this is almost a little bit like when gay people first realized that society was starting to accept them for being openly gay and they immediately went out and started dancing on trucks dressed as giant penises, which on the one hand, is great. But after a certain point, we get it: you love giant penises. Texas expanded its open-carry laws to include handguns. Military rifles and other long guns have been legally openly carried for years.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Conservatives Invent Conspiracy Theory To Blame White Oregon Militia On A Black Guy (VIDEO),"Even the crankiest section of America s right wing is starting to sense that the armed take over of the Oregon refuge is creating some bad press for their movement. But instead of questioning the values that led them there, right-wing nut jobs have created a conspiracy theory that lays the blame at the feet of just one, liberal black man. President Obama.Leading conspiracy nut Alex Jones issued a YouTube rant on Monday, outlining his theory for who is really behind the Oregon attacks. According to Jones, federal plants funded by billionaire liberal George Soros and the Southern Poverty Law Center are manipulating events in Oregon in order to steal our guns. Ladies and gentlemen, don t let Obama be successful when it comes to starting civil unrest and riots in this country,  Jones said.  They will use that as a civil emergency to bring in a type of soft martial law. But Jones is not alone.Right Wing Watch reports that Mike Vanderboegh, the leader of the Three Percenters militia group, issued a blog post over the weekend which laid out a similar conspiracy theory to Jones. He argued that the militia group responsible for the armed takeover of a federal building in Oregon consists of federal provocateurs, sociopaths and idiots with a John Brown complex.   Vanderbough foresees an even darker end to the stand off than Jones though, claiming the militants have  written a check that they expect the rest of us to cash in our own blood in a ghastly civil war. However, despite his criticisms of the group, Vanderboegh states that he and his militia would have no choice but to join a civil war against the federal government and all agencies and individuals acting on its behalf.In short, a group of armed white men take launch a terror attack on U.S. soil, and blame any future fall out on a liberal black guy who favors more effective gun control.And every step of the way, the craven mainstream media is helping the militia group along. It is utterly breathtaking that African American s affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement have been branded  domestic terrorists for non-violent protests over police brutality, yet these white militia-men can seize a federal building, call any enforcement of law an act of civil war   and they are called  protesters. It is little wonder that these gun-wielding lunatics have such a sense of entitlement. They are able to flout the law and threaten extreme violence, while facing zero consequences. While 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead 2.5 seconds after cops found him playing with a toy gun, these men have been able to seize a building with the force of real arms and none suffered so much as a bruised ego. Something is wrong with this picture America.Feature image via CubsInsider",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Did You Spot The ‘Pants On Fire’ Moment In Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad? Politifact Did (VIDEO),"The Trump campaign is busy attempting to clean up the mess after Politifact exposed an incident of gross misrepresentation in its first TV ad.During the 30-second ad which was released Monday, a scene shows supposed migrants rushing through a national border while the voiceover states: He ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for. The clear implication is that the viewer is watching Mexican migrants running across the U.S. border with zero controls or checks.  But  as PolitiFact discovered,  it s not   it s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. The fact checkers uncovered that the footage was first shown on Italian station RepubblikaTV on May 3 2014, and rather than showing Mexican migrants entering the U.S., actually shows: migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. The footage has been shared multiple times across various social media since that time. For example, one YouTube user posted the video in July this year. Again, no mention is made of the U.S. border. Trump scored himself a  pants on fire  rating for putting this nonsense on the air and attempting to mislead the American people as to the state of border security.However, Trump appeared unrepentant when he was called on to Bill O Reilly s show to explain his actions. He told the Fox host on Monday night: I think it s irrelevant. It s really merely a display of what a dumping ground is going to look like. And that s what our country is becoming very rapidly. Proving once again that he has all the personal integrity of a toddler with a cookie jar, the GOP front runner simply steps over his lie and moves on.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Watch Seth Meyers’ Hilarious And Convincing Argument About Trump’s Chances In The Primaries (VIDEO),"With the Republican primaries less then a month away, Donald Trump has started to spend millions on his campaign. While the billionaire can throw plenty of money at Trump-style racist and crazy television ads, he s already received lots of free media attention and leads in most polls. However, late night talk show host Seth Meyers isn t convinced. Myers said: But here s the thing about those polls: There s reason to think they might not really mean anything. One reason is that people hate talking to pollsters   the response rate has fallen from 90 percent to a dismal 8 percent, according to one study, which is a lower response rate than student-loan collector and mother-in-law. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zmnGlWjFWM]Meyers said that there s a correlation with Trump saying  outrageous and offensive things  and the media coverage he receives. The enormous attention he s getting  in combination with these polls makes it seems like Trump is the winning horse. But Meyers isn t buying it. Rudolph Giuliani had a three point lead for the Republican nomination and Howard Dean had a whopping 15 point lead and both went on to fade. For all of us very concerned folks out there that Trump has a shot at the presidency, here are more examples that give us hope that Trump will also fade.In 2007, Hillary Clinton was the clear front runner, polling ahead of John Kerry and John Edwards and she had a huge advantage over Barack Obama by 15 points from January all the way through June. In 2003, Joe Lieberman led in most polls of the Democratic primary but he lost to John Kerry.So, it all comes down to the people who go out and vote and not the polls that precede an election. In one of his speeches that Meyers broadcasts, Trump says,  If I don t win, I will consider this, and I mean it, a total and complete waste of time.  As Meyers said and as I m sure most of the readers out there also think, Trump,  you are not alone. Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Here’s Exactly What Would Happen To The Bundy Militia If They Were Black,"In 1972, a group called the  Christian Movement For Life  was founded by John Africa. Africa and his followers advocated a radical form of green politics, calling for a return to a more natural hunter-gatherer type existence while being opposed to things like scientific advancement and technology. Is this starting to sound similar to certain modern right-wing groups yet?Africa and his followers, who were almost exclusively African-American, eventually renamed their group to MOVE. The members established a commune in a house in West Philadelphia. They participated in demonstrations against institutions they opposed by using bullhorns and shouting out their opinions at all hours of the day or night.MOVE s activities drew the scrutiny of law enforcement over time. This culminated first in 1978 when a nearly year-long standoff with police who were ordering MOVE to leave their collective home ended in violence. MOVE members would not vacate so police decided to break into their home and force them to leave. When this happened, shooting started and a policeman was killed. MOVE claimed none of its own members shot the officer, as he was shot in the back of the head and was facing towards the house at the time. Seven other officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were injured also. As a result of the shooting, nine MOVE members were all sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison for third-degree murder over the officer s death.After the shooting and arrests, remaining MOVE members continued on and in 1981, they re-established their commune in a row house in West Philadelphia. After they settled in, they began the same bullhorn-aided protests they gained notoriety for previously. As before, they got onto local law enforcement s watch list.Neighbors began complaining about the protests and filed health complaints about piles of compost that the group kept on their property. Further pressure from police resulted in indictments of MOVE members for crimes like parole violation, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats. Is this starting to sound even more like certain right-wing groups yet?Eventually, then-Mayor Wilson Goode classified MOVE as a terrorist organization.On May 13th, 1985 all hell broke loose. City manager Leo Brooks arrived with a sizeable police contingent in order to force the eviction of all MOVE members from their home, and arrest of indicted MOVE members. This quickly turned into an armed standoff with police, who began firing tear gas into the rowhomes. Gunfire began, with police returning fire with automatic weapons.This is the most insane part. Police Commissioner Sambor then ordered that the compound was to  be bombed while the MOVE members were still inside. A police helicopter dropped bombs on the roof of the house. Explosions and fires ensued that destroyed sixty-five nearby homes. Firefighters that were on scene stood idle and allowed the fire to continue burning the homes. The same firefighters were just earlier trying to flood the members out of the homes with their hoses.Below is a picture of the aftermath of the MOVE bombing and ensuing fires:MOVE bombing Photo: Phillymag One of the survivors, Ramona Africa, said that police were firing at those who were trying to escape the burning buildings. The firefighters were given orders by the police to allow the fire to continue burning. This allowed the fire to spread to adjacent homes and left two hundred and fifty people homeless. Eleven people (six adults, and five children) burned to death in the fire. Ramona Africa managed to escape the gunfire and flames by crawling out through a broken basement window, even though she suffered severe burns.A commission was quickly formed to investigate the police response, which denounced the actions of the city government, but did not press any criminal charges against anyone involved.Let s compare this, to the response of police and federal law enforcement to the Bundy Militia s armed seizure of a federal public building.Literally not one person from law enforcement is on the scene, as per Oregon Live:During Saturday s rally, not a police officer was visible. And so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory. The FBI is in charge because the refuge is federal property. The Harney County Sheriff s Office and the Oregon State Police are engaged as well.Source: Oregon LiveMOVE was living in their own private home, or homes at the time. Each time, the Bundys were occupying property that did not belong to them.MOVE was classified a terrorist organization. The Bundy militia has yet to receive this distinction after the same amount of incidents as MOVE had occurred.MOVE was ready to shoot, but cops went in anyway. The Bundys are ready to shoot, and the cops are afraid to move in because they didn t want to cause a scene.MOVE ended up in a standoff with cops twice, and violence and death were the results both times. The Bundys have been in a standoff with cops twice, and each time authorities are afraid to act against people literally pointing guns at them because of how it will look if they do.Let s face it. MOVE was mostly black. The Bundys are mostly   if not all   white. Militias seem to be the new pinnacle of the white privilege pyramid in America. How shameful for us all.Featured image via Phillymag",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Fox News Host Megyn Kelly Completely Embarrasses Traitorous Bundy Terrorist (VIDEO),"In an amazing take down of Cliven Bundy s terrorist spawn, Fox News host Megyn Kelly explained how the law works and gave the right-wing loon just enough rope to hang himself with on live television.During the Monday night edition of The Kelly File, Ammon Bundy appeared on the show to defend the armed takeover of a federal wildlife building in Oregon in protest of a pair of ranchers being sent to prison for setting fire to federal land.Bundy made an oft-repeated claim that the federal government has no legal authority under the Constitution to own land. As usual, Bundy is just another right-wing extremist who is totally wrong about the law.According to the Property Clause of the Constitution: The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. Politifact has also rated this claim as  pants on fire  in the past. As their final verdict states:The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.Despite this, poor Megyn Kelly had to sit and listen as an ignorant fool tried to explain his argument to her. Keep in mind that Kelly is a trained attorney.Prior to letting Bundy embarrass himself, Kelly destroyed the idea that the prosecution of Dwight and Steven Hammond was illegal. The Hammonds set fire to federal land and a court of law found them guilty and they were sentenced to five years in prison. The United States Attorney General charged them for burning 139 acres of federal public land that the Hammonds had leased for grazing in order to cover up the illegal killing of several deer.The Hammonds appealed their case all the way to the Supreme Court and lost and surrendered themselves to authorities after denouncing Bundy s group of armed domestic terrorists. You know the argument on the other side,  Kelly said. These ranchers   who you support but are not directly involved [with]   had their day in court. They were found guilty, and it went all the way up to the US Supreme Court, which denied their appeal. Isn t that the way it s supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law? Bundy dodged the question by trying to ask Kelly a question, which she refused to answer because she asks the questions on her show. And that led to Bundy bumbling his way through arguing that the federal government can t own land.Kelly then changed the topic to Bundy s brother Ryan and remarks he made to the Oregonian newspaper that he was prepared to  kill and be killed  for the cause. Well, Ammon Bundy walked that back in quite a hurry, suggesting that his band of gun-toting rednecks are just putting on an act. Well, I have a family. I have six children, a beautiful wife. I have a wonderful home. I have a business, several employees. I m not here to die. I m here to defend my freedoms and my liberties, and will I? Yes. But it s not going to come to that. Here s the video via Raw Story.In short, it appears the right-wing gun nuts are all talk and no walk. They were just hoping the federal government would react but the group has received nothing but ridicule from all sides. Even Ted Cruz is urging them to end the pathetic standoff. And after this on-air schooling by Megyn Kelly, it looks like the ridicule is only going to make these ammosexuals an even bigger punchline.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016"
 Tom Cotton Accepted $1 Million From Israel To Sabotage Iran Nuclear Deal,"How much money does it take for a foreign nation to buy a United States Senator? Just ask Republican Tom Cotton.For a lousy $1 million paycheck, Israel hired Cotton to lead an effort to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama Administration toiled for months to achieve.Bill Kristol s Emergency Committee for Israel donated to Cotton s senatorial campaign and not long after taking office, Cotton penned a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues to Iranian leaders in an attempt to get them to abandon the negotiations by warning that a Republican president will not honor any deal struck.His effort to sabotage important diplomatic negotiations even drew criticism from a former Army General who expressed disappointment because as a former veteran himself, Cotton should know better than to undermine the Commander-in-Chief.In July, Cotton continued his effort by comparing Secretary of State John Kerry and the Iran Deal to Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of Jesus.Then Cotton openly made an oath to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a trip to Israel in which he pledged his allegiance to Israel and vowed to sabotage the Iran deal. Today s meeting only reaffirms my opposition to this deal,  Cotton announced.  I will stand with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel and work with my colleagues in Congress to stop this deal and to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. And this perfectly illustrates how Israel got Republicans to turn against their own country, and is fitting since a recent NSA leak has revealed that Israel did, indeed, bribe GOP members of Congress to rail against the Iran deal.As Addicting Info reported last week,A U.S. intelligence official who was involved in managing the NSA intercepts said Israel s communications with Republicans included such questions as:  How can we get your vote? What s it going to take?  What further denial of treason can be made by either Republicans or Israel at this point?Clearly, Israel successfully bought their new puppets considering Republicans crusaded against the deal for months. And the fact that America s broken campaign finance laws gave Israel the secret opportunity to donate to campaigns like Cotton s only makes Republican and Israeli treachery all the more credible.Cotton got a million dollars for his campaign from an Israel Super PAC and then went to work for his Israeli overlords to sabotage American foreign policy.Sometimes, it really is that simple.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 4, 2016"
 The Worst Environmental Disaster Since The BP Oil Spill Is Happening And The Media Is IGNORING It,"One of the largest environmental disasters in American history is happening right now, and there is a great chance that you never heard of it thanks to corporate-owned media.There is a colossal leak of methane gas currently pouring out of the ground in Aliso Canyon, California, at an astonishing rate of 110,000 pounds per hour. The fallout is intense. 1700 homes in the area have been evacuated so far, prompting many lawsuits to be filed against the corporation that owns the faciliy.Southern California Gas Company is the entity that s responsible for the disaster, which began in October of 2015. A statement by SCGC in December said that stopping the leak would take at least 2 more months.Below you can see video footage of just how bad the leak is:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exfJ8VPQDTY&w=420&h=315]The severity of this can t understated. This single leak is accounting for 25 percent of the entire state s methane emissions, and has been classified as the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas as well, marking this as a signicant ecological threat.Anne Silva, spokesperson for SCGC, made the following statement: Our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful, so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well.The relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late February or late March. Source: MotherboardThe part that is making it so difficult to deal with, is the fact that the well is 8,000 feet deep. This is preventing the normal disaster recovery method of plugging the leak with fluids from working, due to too much pressure coming up from underground. The hope is that the relief well will drain off some pressure from the main well, allowing the fluid plug to work as intended.If you thought this was the only methane leak in California, you were wrong. The reality is far worse.In Pasadena, 35 miles from the Aliso Canyon leak, investigators found a cluster of leaks at 4 miles or less from each other. Below is a map of them, courtesy of Earth Defense Fund:Image credit: EDFWhere the hell is the accountability for this? The map above should be a criminal offense.The story of Southern California Gas Company is a pretty damning one. EDF has found that more than 38 percent of the methane pipes that SCGC manages are more than 50 years old, and 16 percent are made from sub standard materials prone to leaks and corrosion. Over 150 million pounds of methane have been released by the leak so far, and that isn t counting the huge cluster of leaks shown above.Lets put this into perspective. If 1700 families had to evacuate a California town because of volcano suddenly springing up, it would be everywhere in the media. There would be a nightly obsession over it on cable news. Politicians on every level would be pledging to help, and doing everything they can to hasten relief efforts.If we had a terrorist act that caused 1700 people to have to evacuate an American town, we would already be invading multiple middle eastern countries that had nothing to do with it.Instead, we have 1700 people displaced by an ecological disaster caused by a corporation, and the media response is  What disaster?

 Obama Details 4 Actions He’s Doing NOW To Fight Gun Violence: NRA Rage Incoming (TWEETS),"President Obama isn t lying down and playing dead as the NRA and their congressional lackeys allow guns to proliferate across America at an alarming pace. In the first month of his last full year in office, President Obama is launching a new series of executive actions squarely aimed at cutting down the amount of victims of gun violence we see from coast to coast.The White House released a fact sheet detailing 4 immediate steps the President would be taking to try to break the back of the gun lobby.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will demand that businesses selling guns   at a store, a gun show, online, or out of the trunk of a car   get a license and conduct background checks before selling a weapon. The ATF will also work on a rule requiring background checks for sales of dangerous weapons through trusts, corporations or other legal entities.The FBI will also overhaul the background check system and hire 230 additional examiners and other staff to process applications.The 2017 budget will include funds for 200 new ATF investigators and agents to fight gun crime, while the ATF has established an investigation center to track guns sold over the internet used for crimes. A new ATF rule will push gun dealers to notify law enforcement officials if their guns are lost and stolen while in transit   something many probably assumed was a law already.After each mass shooting, Republicans often blame  mental health  treatment for the shooting   but then do nothing legislative to help families dealing with mental health issues. President Obama will propose $500 million in funding for increased access to mental health care.Additionally, the Social Security Administration and Department of Health and Human Services will issue new rules adding information about mental health conditions to background checks and removing barriers to states receiving information about the mental health problems for those trying to buy guns.President will direct the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology, including the availability of smart gun technology. That tech would help to prevent the  accidental  firing of weapons, seemingly no-brainer technology that many gun owners support, but which is opposed by the NRA.President Obama issued a series of tweets kicking off the administration s rollout of these executive actions.Each year, more than 30,000 American lives are cut short by guns   two-thirds coming from suicides. Too many Americans have lost loved ones.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Tomorrow, I'm taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives   protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. pic.twitter.com/vNqXEhaC9M  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.

 You Have To See Ammon Bundy’s Ridiculous Press Conference In Oregon (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy, the son of the secessionist rancher Cliven Bundy, held a rambling, incoherent press conference on Monday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The 40-year-old Bundy rancher defended convicted ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond, even though the Hammonds don t really want help from the Bundy brothers. Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder told reporters,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family. But off he went anyway: We have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution. They have come down upon on the people,  Ammon Bundy said in a press conference Monday.  They are coming down into the state and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress. Among other things, Bundy announced the name of his group: Citizens For Constitutional Freedom.Bundy also presented a  redress of grievances,  read by another member of his group. The grievances were endorsed by other militia groups, such as (we re not making these up) Oregon Bearded Bastards, the Oregon Oath Keepers and the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard. I know, I know. The  Oregon Bearded Bastards  sound like they could totally annihilate the U.S. government and its pawns in the military. Look out, Marines! (Meanwhile, the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard smartly used the word  guard  instead of the original suggestion,  Central Oregon Constitutional Klan  or  C.O.C.K.  The acronym would ve been problematic. #Joke)The big takeaway from the press conference is this: the Bundys are clearly milking their 15 minutes by piggybacking their ridiculous agenda onto the Hammond agenda. Together, it s one big dumb agenda, fueled by fantasies of 1776   as if there s any realistic chance that an armed conflict with the government wouldn t end with these posers in body bags.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 4, 2016"
 This Anti-Government Oregon Terrorist Took Thousands In Government Money,"One of the ringleaders of the terror-minded militia group who are illegally occupying a National Park service building got a six figure loan from the government   the same government that they accuse of being a despotic, criminal enterprise.Ammon Bundy, the son of rogue Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, heads the group and has been their front man in communication with the press. He already tasted the national standoff when his father refused to pay his bill to the Bureau of Land Management, even after using the government land for his personal enrichment.It turns out that despite the Bundy rhetoric about government and its supposed encroachment into their personal liberty, they were not above putting their hands out for some green.Ammon Bundy runs a Phoenix-based company called Valet Fleet Services LLC, which specializes in repairing and maintaining fleets of semitrucks throughout Arizona. On April 15, 2010 Tax Day, as it happens Bundy s business borrowed $530,000 through a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program. The available public record does not indicate what the loan was used for or whether it was repaid. The SBA website notes that this loan guarantee was issued under a program  to aid small businesses which are unable to obtain financing in the private credit marketplace.  The government estimated that this subsidy could cost taxpayers $22,419. Bundy did not respond to an email request for comment about the SBA loan.This is the same sort of mindset we ve seen for years and years on the mainstream right. Out of one side of the mouth comes words condemning the government, often attacking those who have sought help from the government   particularly ethnic minorities who dare to receive government support, even temporarily. From the other side of the mouth they are more than willing to build their personal fortunes on top of government help and assistance. Help for me, not for thee. They may as well be part of the Tea Party crowd demanding that the government take its hands off Medicare.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016"
" Anti-Government Terrorists Forgot Snacks, Want You To Send Via U.S. Mail","On Thursday Blaine Cooper, one of the anti-government terrorists who is participating in the armed takeover of a bird sanctuary in Oregon, put out a call for snacks on social media.According to the terrorist group, now known as Ya llQueda, the armed militants decided to seize the more than 100 year old wildlife refuge because it is a symbol of everything that is wrong in America, such as not being able to set fire to public lands, turn your freeloading cattle loose to feed off American taxpayers, or even ride your ATV through ancient archaeological sites, the way, according to Ammon Bundy  we used to could do. The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908. ATV s came on the market in the U.S. in the 1960 s. The stupidity of right wing extremism is timeless.In case you needed more proof that this is the dumbest armed takeover of a bird sanctuary EVER, the anti-government terrorists who told America that they plan to stay holed up inside the visitor s building of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  for as long as it takes,  even  for years,  are asking people to send snacks.During a secretive press conference held on the second day of Ya llQueda s armed occupation of the federal wildlife refuge, Bundy told the press, We do have a plan and that plan is going to take several months to accomplish. What kind of idiotic plan involves living in the visitor s building of a wildlife sanctuary for  months,  even  years if necessary,  but does not also include packing snacks?Image credit: screen capture, Blaine Cooper, via Independent UKNot only is Ya llQueda already begging for snacks, but these admitted haters of the federal government would like you to send them snacks via the U.S. mail.You just cannot get any dumber than these people.(You might recognize self-proclaimed militia leader Blaine Cooper from this video, or even from the Bundy ranch fiasco, last year.)During the press conference on Saturday, Bundy referred to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, with its 320 bird species, as a  tool of tyranny. According to the official website, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major tourist attraction and a staple of the local economy. The festival draws visitors from all over the world, and reservations for bird-viewing tours fill up almost as soon as they become available.In Bundy s delusional mind he s a hero and a patriot setting an oppressed people free from bird tyranny. In the minds of the residents of Harney County, he s a lunatic.More than 50 percent of the residents of Harney County work for the government. As OPB reports here, the town has always had a collaborative, rather than an antagonistic relationship with the federal government. Signs posted throughout the town, reading  Go home militia,  make it clear enough that Bundy and his followers aren t wanted there.Bundy claims he s  giving the land back to the people.  Never mind that it s PUBLIC land, or that it already belongs to the people. Need we mention that Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was accessible to everyone right up until the day these assholes took it over, causing the government to have to close it down for public safety reasons?What these dipshits have a problem with is being asked to respect public land, and to help protect it for future generations. They want to be able to let their cows graze on it at the expense of other taxpayers. They want to be able to ride their ATV s through it and drive their pickup trucks over it (in other words exploit and destroy it) and who the hell cares about nesting birds anyways? They also want to be able to poach wildlife and burn down the forest if they feel like it, just like the two criminals they re trying so hard to turn into martyrs for their utterly stupid cause.If the government is smart, they ll send these idiots a dozen boxes of Ding Dong s laced with some hard core tranquilizers. Knock their dumb-asses out. Take away their guns. Let them wake up in jail where they belong. No-one gets hurt. The public gets its land back from these delusional lunatics. Bundy and the rest of the #Yeehawdists with him all get prison time and felony records, meaning they ll never be allowed to own guns or terrorize their fellow citizens again.Sounds like a good plan to me.Watch: Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders behind the terrorist takeover in Oregon, explains the Constitution and stuff on youtube.*Featured image credit: video screen capture, via Southern Nevada Watchdogs on youtube",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Bill Clinton Reminds People Of Hillary’s LONG History Of Getting Things Done (VIDEO),"If there s one couple that Republicans love to attack, it s the Clintons. For decades, they have been under constant dubious scrutiny, more so than almost any other politician. Why? Because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done. Stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed, and work they would rather not see being accomplished. If Republicans can successfully make a scandal of the Clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments, that will help Republicans beat Hillary in 2016. It s political theater at its best and worst.Appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in Nashua, New Hampshire, was former President Bill Clinton. If anyone can explain the exemplary work Hillary has done throughout her long career, it s Bill. And while many like to say Hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea, or copies other candidates, they clearly don t know the work she s done, and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done, but getting it done. This pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office.The former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at Yale, and while she really could have done anything with her career, she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the Children s Defense Fund. He said: There she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  She hadn t been elected to anything, but everything she touched became better. As TIME so perfectly summed up Clinton s remarks: He remembered that Hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in Arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of African-American children in adult prisons in South Carolina.In another anecdote, Bill said that Hillary as First Lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late 1990s with Tom DeLay, then a leading Republican in the House of Representatives. This is all in addition to her later political work, like in helping get the Iran Deal passed, or her part in capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe, all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation.Clinton stated: I do not believe in my lifetime, anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now. Her experience speaks volumes. Her calm under pressure is unmatched, and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished.It s clear Bill is in this to win it for Hillary, and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition.It will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer.

 Guns In Schools Advocate Slammed By BBC Host (AUDIO),"During an interview with a BBC Live Host, a Texas gun advocate defended his state s new gun law policies by saying that the only way to stop gun violence is to arm more people. C.J. Grisham, president of the gun advocacy group Open Carry Texas and a candidate for the state senate believes that law-abiding citizens should be able to access guns easily in order to counter those who have them illegally. He said: You can pass all the background checks you want, but a criminal gang member in Chicago isn t going to run a background check on another gang member. The host then interrupted Grisham and asked:  Sorry. How many of the mass college shootings were carried out by criminal gang members? Grisham responds,  Well they were all carried out by criminals, not licensed carriers. The host then asks,  So how did those people manage to access the weaponry that led to all of those deaths then? Illegally. That s what I m saying,  said Grisham.The host continues to drill Grisham by asking,  How do you tighten that up then?  Grisham s response is ridiculous: Well, you can t stop all crime. You tighten it up by getting rid of gun-free zones and allowing people to defend themselves no matter where they walk, no matter where they go, no matter where they study. So, just to be clear, C.J.  asked the host,  The solution is actually having more guns in circulation in America. Therefore, when a Columbine happens, a teacher can open fire in a classroom against the assailant. So, guns in classrooms? You advocate that? Well, there s already guns in classrooms. It s just that they re in the hands of criminals and the good guys can t defend themselves,  said Grisham.The guns used in the Columbine shooting were bought from an unlicensed private seller.  The guns: Were all purchased for them by Dylan Klebold s girlfriend, 18-year-old Columbine student Robyn Anderson, who accompanied the two 17-year-olds to the Tanner Gun Show outside Denver, shopping with their cash. She was what is called a straw purchaser, but it would not have been necessary, since youths were allowed to buy rifles and shotguns in Colorado and no background checks are necessary when guns are sold by individuals rather than federally-licensed gun dealers. President Obama is currently proposing laws that would crack down on that type of easy access.Grisham s logic is very flawed. His idea is that if a person is in possession of a gun, then that person is likely to be safer in an unsafe situation. However,  a gun is more likely to discharge accidentally in the home or be used by a family member against another family member rather than against an intruder. The reality is that the more guns are around, the more likely the gun will not be used  for self-defense against a criminal.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQKpAmC3ASk]Feature Image Via YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Watch These Students SHUT DOWN Fox Host For Mocking ‘Rape Hysteria’ And ‘Repeated Consent’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious, life-threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important. So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called  Campus Rape Hysteria,  and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable. Stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience. Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex. California s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity. That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say,  Yes, please proceed.  I doubt many college students do that  but it is the law! To get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women. He said: The kids must laugh at it. I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent. Yet many students voiced the exact opposite. One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done. I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.

 The Three Things The Oregon ‘Patriots’ REALLY Want That Nobody Is Talking About (VIDEO),"As soon as the news spread that there was some kind of a  takeover  of federal land combined with the name  Bundy,  ears across America perked up. However, this isn t Cliven Bundy himself but rather his son Ammon, who is just as stubborn   and since everyone seems to have missed it   extremely greedy.Greedy like his Daddy. In 2014, Cliven decided his cattle should get to graze for free and that the more than million dollars in fees he owed the US taxpayer was  tyranny.  Armed freaks from across the country showed up when BLM agents seized Bundy s cattle and pointed assault rifles at them until the cattle were returned and Bundy was left alone.The federal government allowed the cattle to be returned, but Bundy is far from out of the woods.Now son Ammon has started his very own revolution, breaking into a federal building located on a wildlife refuge in Oregon, a federally protected plot of land with the strictest of rules as far as fires, hunting, alcohol and stupidity go, four things the  patriots  who have moved in will certainly partake in.The episode started when a local rancher and his son were sentenced to federal prison for setting over 100 acres of public land on fire to cover up their poaching. After a protest of their incarceration, Bundy and company took the piece of forest and released a video recruiting more  Murikans, promising them food and a place to stay. Just bring your guns.At the beginning of that video, Bundy lays out three goals for the area, highlighting the kind of person he actually is. Bundy clearly says he s going to  protect  the people and bring back the ranchers, miners and loggers:When you cast aside all of the  I love my country  BS and the  we re here for the people  garbage, you ll see that Bundy and pals targeted a wildlife management area because the things they think they re going to start doing there are strictly forbidden.Ranchers aren t welcome to graze their thousands of head of cattle, because the land has been designated as a natural resource. It s a place where a natural ecosystem can actually survive without being decimated by cattle. Bundy would, of course, change that and with his intention to be there  for years  if necessary, you know he s thinking setting up a cattle operation might be a good idea.Miners aren t allowed to strip or tunnel, because it s been determined that the risk to the environment of that area is too great from the pollution mining inherently brings to streams and groundwater. You d think the ranchers would care about the heavy metal poisoning of their cattle, but for some reason they don t.Loggers aren t allowed to chop down the forest in an area like this for obvious reasons. Things live in trees, and in this area, this tiny protected little world of plants, animals, streams and ponds, living things are essential.The Bundy stance is about greed. It s about the mentality that just because you ve lived in a place a long time you have the right to destroy it. For private property that may be true; you may destroy your own property at will, but that land next door owned by the taxpayer? We have laws and such about that land. It isn t yours. These people have been mooching for free for so long off of the U.S. government   and therefore the taxpayer   that they would have no idea how to live on their own.Yes, these are the same people who call people getting food benefits  lazy.

 Tennessee GOP Lawmaker Offers To Fund Bundy Terrorists’ Armed Insurgency (SCREENSHOTS),"Most Republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right-wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in Oregon   but not Tennessee state Rep. Andy Holt.Despite that this group of Yee-Hawdists made tear-filled  goodbye  videos in case they died in a shootout with the Army,  occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (or, as ABC said with plenty of sugarcoating, engaged in an  action  after a peaceful protest), and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause, all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation (protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land)   the very definition of terrorism   we don t even see 1/100 of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality.Holt tweeted   and deleted   what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to Vanilla ISIS.Holt compared the armed militia, which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to  kill or be killed  with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in Ferguson or Baltimore: While Holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which African-Americans are standing up for their rights, he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation-state by force.The Tenth Amendment, of course, does not authorize a mob of right-wing terrorists to occupy anything, by force or not   nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government. However, as one Democrat, Chattanooga City Councilman Chris Anderson,  pointed out, Holt s offer to help the Bundy terrorists may constitute Treason.While Holt may think he understands the 10th Amendment, he doesn t quite grasp Article III of the Constitution, which states:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.In fact, U.S.C.S 2383 covers insurrection quite nicely, as well:Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Anderson has asked the Justice Department to investigate. Holt, of course, dismissed Anderson s concerns with the tried-and-true  Yeah, well you re gay  response:He says that he deleted his treasonous offer  so liberal loons will quit responding  but whines that  More liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate.  Get off Twitter & read the Constitution, kids,  he said, ironically.Perhaps Anderson is right that Holt   who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government   should be investigated for treason.Featured image via screengrab/YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016"

She then left go to the neighbor s house.The girl told police she had been held against her will by her boyfriend and that he had also threatened her with a handgun. She also told officers that he had threatened to shoot the police.Virginia is one of several Republican states that recently pushed to make it easier for people to have and carry guns. It seems to be working out well.The police surrounded Silva s house, and Silva took advantage of his infamy by   what else?   posting to his social media accounts about his siege with police and chatting with friends.But while Silva would have loved to posture himself as a gun-toting badass, things didn t work out that way. He eventually surrendered   and was promptly arrested with his pants falling to his ankles.

Silva was already a convicted felon. On top of the new charges of abduction, he was slapped with another felony, illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.His legions of gun nut fans will probably be disappointed, but the streets are probably much safer with Bryan Silva off of Vine and the streets.Feature image via Newsplex",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Mark Zuckerberg’s PERFECT Facebook Comment To Grandmother Proves He’s A Badass Feminist,"There are seldom people in life that you can honestly say are solidly good people, but Mark Zuckerberg is one of those few that could fall into that category. Not because of his creation of Facebook, which in and of itself is extraordinary, but because of what he says and does. His actions, throughout his career, have spoken louder than words.From his $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey schools, to giving $25 million in the fight against Ebola, to most recently saying this in a Facebook post to his new daughter:Now, in yet another Facebook post, Zuckerberg offered his New Years resolution which included reading two books a month, creating a Jarvis from  Iron Man  artificial butler for his own personal use, and exploring the future advancement of technology.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Every year, I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside my work at Facebook.

Don t tell your daughters or teach your daughters to date the nerds, tell them to BE the life-changing geniuses!And while what this woman was saying was all done with a good heart, and good intentions, Zuckerberg s quick shift in thought process, and ability to point out that women are just as capable as men, is pretty damn awesome.Well done, Mark!

" Patriot Can’t Wait To Go Fight Gubmint With Oregon Militia, Just Needs Welfare Check First","You know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government, but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check? This right-wing patriot sure does!Among the thousands (upon thousands) of delusional anti-government comments the Bundy Ranch Facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a Oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right-wing nut job, who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it.You read that right, Daniel Brewer here can t spend the $300 he estimates he ll need to get to Oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet. Instead, he sends his  prayers  to the Oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement.First identified by blogger Jim Wright of Stonekettle.com, the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti-government extremists manage to live in. It may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government, but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case, a literal check every month so you can get by.This isn t the first time we ve seen right-wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government. During the ugly healthcare debate, one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed Obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare.  Medicare, you may remember, is a government healthcare plan. President Obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti-government government users. He recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by Fox News that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the ACA: I got a letter the other day from a woman. She said,  I don t want government-run health care. I don t want socialized medicine. And don t touch my Medicare.' Yikes.Our hapless anti-government militia sympathizer is, unsurprisingly, a conspiracy enthusiast as well. Scattered among pictures of his family, Brewer s Facebook page features dozens of right-wing memes and articles suggesting Muslims are imposing Sharia Law in America (they re not) and calls for Obama to resign (he isn t).The conclusion we can draw from this is clear: Many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it. They don t want to pay taxes (who does?) and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want, but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them.Feature image via SBNation",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Megyn Kelly Reveals The Creepy Way Donald Trump Tried To ‘Woo’ Her (IMAGE),"Donald Trump has singled out many people during his campaign, but none have remained a target in Trump s eyes and Twitter feed quite like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump s issue with Kelly exploded after the first Republican debate, when Kelly understandably called Trump out on his long-winded history of sexist, misogynistic comments toward women. Trump, being the abrasive a**hole that he is, blew the incident way out of proportion and continued to slam Kelly both on and off Twitter for weeks after the debate. Now Kelly is speaking out against Trump, claiming that the business mogul had actually tried to  woo  her in some incredibly creepy ways   which may have influenced why he was so bitter when she called him out.Vanity FairThis month Kelly graces the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, in which the 45-year-old journalist spoke about her interactions with The Donald at length. Kelly said that Trump used to send her press clippings that were signed  Donald Trump , and called her numerous times to tell her how much he enjoyed certain segments of her show (ironically, after the debate Trump criticized Kelly s show extensively). Kelly didn t think much of this at first, but when Trump announced he was going to run for president, Kelly said  it became more clear. But, Kelly said that Trump s efforts were completely futile. She said: I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. I would have crawled over a pile of hot coals to make it to that debate. No one was going to be sitting in for me, reading my questions. And I can say with confidence that neither Bret nor Chris wanted to read my questions   for many reasons! Kelly revealed that her decision to focus on Trump s sexist remarks was because she knew Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would zero in on them if they faced each other in the general election. Part of what Kelly said to Trump was: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about womens  looks. You once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton   who is likely to be the Democratic nominee   that you are a part of the war on women? It was one of the most reported moments from the debate, and Kelly received attacks from both Trump AND his loyal followers for holding him accountable. Trump lovers sent her death threats, called her a c t  and a  hag  on social media   even Trump s top deputy retweeted  gut her. Trump was especially immature about the situation, and he took his disdain for being confronted to new heights when he told CNN s Don Lemon that Kelly had  blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her   wherever.  Then, the Republican frontrunner threatened to boycott Fox and continued to diss Kelly for weeks after the debate   only further proving her point about Trump s misogyny.Featured image via Vanity Fair",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Wow: Did The Palins Lie About When Bristol’s Baby Was Born To Cover Up The Truth? (IMAGES),"Conspiracy theories aren t something I take seriously very often. The type of people who engage in conspiracy theories spend their time on Alex Jones  site talking about false flags and how mass shootings are a hoax. Fourteen years later, and they just can t admit that steel does in fact bend and melt and buildings fall down when you crash big planes into them.To be grouped with the crazies is inconceivable, but every so often something comes along that seems far-fetched   until you look closely. This particular theory is brought to you by the Blogspot Right Wing Crooks, who seem to have figured out how and why Bristol Palin s baby was born in November and not December like she claims.The entire story goes into great detail about individual Instagram, Facebook and Twitter posts, friends of the family and the supposed father and former fiance brought in to make it all neat and clean. In a nutshell, the theory is that Bristol Palin was impregnated in or around the time she was in Las Vegas last year complaining about  the night that ruined her life  a month before a Medal of Honor winner mysteriously appears to sweep her off her feet, propose and become an immediate fixture in all aspects of her public, private and online life.The timeline begins on Palin s Instagram on Valentines Day.  A selfie of her and an Alaskan prostitute adult industry worker dressed to impress for a night on the town appears with the caption  The night before the worst mistake of my life.  The picture is still there, but the caption, as reported by Right Wing Crooks, has been changed to #Vegas.If that was the night Bristol Palin was impregnated, a typical gestation period would bring her into early to mid-November for a due date. The fist picture of Bristol with her new daughter, Sailor, appeared on Christmas Eve:The Palins are notorious attention seekers. Up to this point, there was no mention of babies or deliveries or hospitals. All of a sudden, bam. There s Bristol, looking content with her daughter.Sarah hadn t posted at all either, but when she did there was a bit of a problem. When you post to Facebook your location is logged. Sarah Palin was somehow holding and loving on her brand new granddaughter in a Hospital in Parker, Alaska but posting to Facebook from New Orleans. Here is the actual post:https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10153836923483588Things got really fishy when a picture of Bristol and her little girl showed a piece of tape with an IV date on it. After enhancing, both Right Wing Crooks and Winning Democrats are convinced that the date most likely reads 11/4/15. November 4th, which by the Vegas pregnancy theory puts Sailor at exactly where she s supposed to be gestation-wise.Here are the pictures with enhancements:Right Wing CrooksThe theory is simple. To keep Bristol from looking like she got knocked up during a one night stand, a plan was formulated to move the birth. Bristol took pictures along the way, posting them a month or two in advance. If yopu check out her Instagram account, you ll see that at 32 weeks (according to her) pregnant she looked pretty along:32 weeks with my babe girl ?   A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Oct 29, 2015 at 10:36pm PDTThat from October 29th to this on Thanksgiving, an entire month later? And what s with the Christmas tree? It s almost like the whole thing is just staged:Happy Thanksgiving ? .. thankful for my babies  A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Nov 26, 2015 at 12:03pm PSTHow far-fetched is it really? You would simply have to consider what Sarah and the Palins would do to keep Bristol safe from the career (doing whatever it is she does) ending publicity of a one-night stand Vegas baby. Already her position as an abstinence counselor makes absolutely no sense, so that s kind of a wash, but with the Duggaresque hypocrisy of Bristol being a faith blogger on Patheos and possibly a future  where are they now  Dancing With The Stars special guest, the concept of changing a couple of months for a clean(er) slate may have been just that appealing.Did she fake the birth of her daughter nearly two months after it happened? According to Right Wing Crooks there are a slew of other tidbits that add to their theory:That is all admittedly very compelling stuff. It is also very circumstantial. If it turns out to be true it will go down as a not-so-well-planned scandal from America s first family of fools. If it s not true, well shame on the Palins for having an existence that makes it seem plausible.Featured image via Instagram",News,"January 4, 2016"
" Scalia Admits He’s Never Read The Constitution, Says Government Can Endorse Religion","It s clear as day in the First Amendment, but Justice Antonin Scalia apparently has never read it or he is blatantly ignoring it. Either way, such idiocy does not belong on the Supreme Court.The Establishment Clause of the Constitution states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof This means that the government cannot support one religion over another , and nor can government promote religion over non-religion.But conservative Justice Scalia declared otherwise during a speech at a Catholic high school in Louisiana.According to the Associated Press,  Scalia said Saturday the idea of religious neutrality is not grounded in the country s constitutional traditions and that God has been good to the U.S. exactly because Americans honor him. To tell you the truth there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition,  Scalia claimed.  Where did that come from?  he asked.  To be sure, you can t favor one denomination over another but can t favor religion over non-religion? Scalia went on to claim that America has been successful because of God and argued that the government should honor the Christian deity, telling the students to not let anyone tell them otherwise. God has been very good to us. That we won the revolution was extraordinary. The Battle of Midway was extraordinary. I think one of the reasons God has been good to us is that we have done him honor. Unlike the other countries of the world that do not even invoke his name we do him honor. In presidential addresses, in Thanksgiving proclamations and in many other ways. There is nothing wrong with that and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that. The Hill reports that Scalia also had words for Americans who support secularism. Don t cram it down the throats of an American people that has always honored God on the pretext that the Constitution requires it. This is a man who sits on the Supreme Court of the United States, yet he has a profound ignorance of one of the most important parts of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers added the Establishment Clause precisely because they did not want the government supporting religion in any way.Apparently, Scalia thinks he knows more about the Constitution than Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, both of whom wrote that the Establishment Clause erected a wall of separation between church and state. I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, 1802 Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person s life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the  wall of separation between church and state,  therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society. We have solved   the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson: in a speech to the Virginia Baptists, 1808 The civil government functions with complete success by the total separation of the Church from the State.  ~Founding Father James Madison, 1819, Writings, 8:432, quoted from Gene Garman,  Essays In Addition to America s Real Religion Every new and successful example of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance.  ~Founding Father James Madison, letter, 1822Scalia is an embarrassment who should resign from the bench in disgrace. For someone who calls himself an originalist on the Court when it comes to interpreting the Constitution, it sure sounds like he has no idea what the Establishment Clause means even though it s pretty clearly worded and has been clearly explained by two Founding Fathers. If Scalia had his way, the United States would be declared a Christian state and Christianity would be forced down our throats every day despite the fact that such a thing is forbidden by the Constitution.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Happy 2016! Republicans Already Promise To Be F*cking Useless This Year,"Well that didn t take long at all did it? 2016 is only a few days old and already Republicans have vowed to do everything in their power to continue screwing America. Why? Because they re absolutely spineless and don t want to make the Tea Party mad. Seriously, that s the entire reason. One of the two major parties of the United States of America is so afraid of a tiny group of racist morons that they re willing to do or say ANYTHING to keep them happy.Speaker of the Mouse House Paul Ryan has already promised that Republicans are going to vote on repealing Obamacare again:Now it appears that Ryan earned the faint support of Congressional Republicans by promising to get back to the business of negation and legislative navel-gazing. This was evident in Ryan s statement about his plans for Congress in January: When we return in January, the House will put an ObamaCare repeal bill on the floor and pass it and put it on the president s desk We are going to keep working to give families relief from this law while we work to dismantle and replace it altogether. Yes, because millions of families that have never had health insurance before need relief from the burden of having health insurance. And someone please let me know when Republicans figure out exactly what the  replace  part of their big plan is.Salon s Sean Illing summed up the GOP s actions quite nicely when he pointed out that,  each of these votes, like the recent Benghazi hearing, was a masturbatory exercise in political theater.  In other words, Republicans are wasting the taxpayer s time and money for the sole purpose of creating anti-government Tea Party porn.Senate Republicans will be just as useless as Mitch McConnell has promised to keep persecuting refugees. Refugees, if you ll recall, are the Greatest Threat To America Of All Time  because 1 of them might someday do something bad. Meanwhile, a group of armed white Christian extremists have seized a federal building and are threatening to shoot government officials. But, you know, McConnell is worried about those wascally refugees fleeing war and violence. Murika.Featured image via Cagle Cartoons",News,"January 4, 2016"
 John Oliver Has Brilliant Advice For Breaking That New Year’s Resolution You Won’t Keep Anyway (VIDEO),"It s a new year. For many of us, that means that we probably made a few resolutions. You know   quit smoking, eat better, drink less, get more sleep   all good things that could improve life. There s just one problem, though: most people don t keep those resolutions. They go right out the window before the first month of the new year is even over for most people. Well, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight has some advice in that arena: You re going to break these resolutions anyway, so quit being so hard on yourself.Oliver said: Every December, for some reason, we decide that next year will be the one that everything turns around and we ll finally quit drinking, or learn how to pronounce the name of these berries.  He then continued: But let s be honest, we re a few days into the new year now, and if you haven t broken your New Year s resolutions yet, statistically you are about to. That can be depressing. But don t panic, all hope is not lost. Because the key thing with resolutions is not how to keep them   it s how to revise them once you ve failed. The main problem with New Year s resolutions is that we set our expectations way too high. For instance, lots of people say they want to exercise more   but that s hard. Exercise is like reading for your muscles. Except you can t watch a movie of someone else exercising and basically get the gist of it. He s right. Humans are set in our ways. Small changes are better than big ones, because they are easier to stick to. You re not going to change your whole life just because a new year rolls in, and that really is okay.Watch Oliver s hilarious  yet completely accurate   thoughts on New Year s resolutions below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 4, 2016"
" FBI FINALLY Does Its Job, Starts Monitoring Oregon Militia Terrorists","Some of America s pretend patriots have taken over the federal building of a wildlife reserve in Oregon. Over the weekend as the internet and news organizations were abuzz with news of this outrageous and illegal activity, one entity was suspiciously and conspicuously missing from the equation: The federal government. Yes, you read that right. At first, the government had absolutely no plans to take action against these people. Why? Because they are white Christians. That really is it. Look at how, in stark contrast, they treat Black Lives Matter protesters, or think of how this situation would have played out if these people had been brown Muslims instead.Well, finally, the government has decided to do its job. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now monitoring the situation with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation by self proclaimed militia members and supposed defenders of the Constitution, which they have clearly not read and understood. If they had, they would not be doing this at all.The occupation is taking place in Harney County, where the sheriff there, David. M. Ward, has told his law abiding citizens to avoid the situation. While the militia members claim to be there defending local ranchers, Ward says that the group s intent is something much more sinister: These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives, to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. As per usual with such people, known anti-government extremist Jon Ritzheimer has warned authorities that the group is armed: Yes, there are some people that are armed. We need to defend our rights. That s what the Second Amendment is there for, people. Senator Ron Wyden (D- Oregon), who has been in touch with the local authorities on this ongoing situation, says that the FBI is definitely monitoring things: The FBI is on this every minute. But based on comments from what we ve heard in the community and what s been reported, we may be in just the early stages of this. Indeed. These are right-wing nuts, some of whom have already said that they are prepared to die here. They won t give up easily.This is nothing more than bona fide domestic terrorism. Arrest them. All of them. They really need to be made to realize that they are not above the law.Americans seem to be so worried about terrorism. Well, we re growing it right here at home   and we aren t doing anything about it. And that s the problem.Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 4, 2016"
 Paul Krugman: Obama Rolled Back RONALD REAGAN’S Tax Cuts For The Rich,"Paul Krugman, by his own admission, has been drooling over the release of the IRS s 2013 tax tables. If you re still awake after reading that sentence, congratulations! You have the stamina of a bull! But seriously, while tax codes and forms and statistics and charts and zzzzzzzz .. may be boring as all hell to you and me, they re still useful. Specifically, they re useful in determining the impact of Obama s Nazi Socialist Commie Homosexual Muslim Agenda  on America.And no matter how  disappointed  you are that Obama did not turn the United States into Utopia, he still managed to do something amazing:According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.And what does that mean? It means Obama, that terrible, terrible disappointment that supposedly only serves his corporate masters took a large bite out of Reganomics:But the available numbers are consistent with Congressional Budget Office projections of the effects of the 2013 tax increases   projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre-Reagan level. No, really: for top incomes, Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan s as well.Any economist not working for a billionaire s think tank will tell you in no uncertain terms that Reagan s (and Bush s) claims were total bullshit. Giving more money to the rich does not improve the economy, it only makes the rich richer and hurts everyone else. Since the 80s, we ve handed billions every year to the rich and they took that money and invested it in buying politicians and factories in other countries. Now we have definitive proof, in the form of the strongest job growth since the Dot Com bubble of the 90s, that taking those tax cuts away will not hurt the economy in any way whatsoever.Thanks, Obama!Featured image via Business Insider",News,"January 4, 2016"

" Donald Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad Is Here, And It’s Worse Than We Imagined (VIDEO)","While an armed militia group of domestic terrorists seize and occupy a federal building by force, GOP Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has released his first campaign TV ad. It s worse than we imagined.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. In this small catchphrase lay a few assumptions. Firstly, that America is not great now. Secondly, that it ever was great. Thirdly, all the assumptions around what exactly is wrong, and what would restore the nation to greatness.Let s pretend for a moment that the first and the second assumptions are true. It is certainly ground that liberals and conservatives might share. That is what is so enticing about the statement, but when progressives list the greatest issues facing America, they often come up with things like:But if you were hoping optimistically that any of these issue were going to be addressed in Trump s campaign ad   you ll be bitterly disappointed. What three things will Donald Trump do to make America great again?The eagle-eyed amongst you will note, none of these three things in any way relates to the major issues facing America in the coming decade and century.Where are our next great engineers, inventors and scientists going to come from when we have the worst education system in the developed world? If we aren t growing them at home, and we can t import them due to immigration bans, how on earth is America going to be great in these fields?It is not only that Trump and the GOP do not have the answers to the biggest questions of our age, it s that they aren t even asking those questions. Trump doesn t want to make America great again, he wants to make America white again. He is speaking only to the frightened, white folks of the land who genuinely believe anybody other than rich white people (lawmakers, business leaders and presidents past) are responsible for the decline of the nation.As Hillary Clinton put it in New Hampshire this week: You can t make America great again if you insult and demean the people of America.

 Nobody In Oregon Seems To Want The Bundy Militia There,"After going to all the trouble of leaving their bunkers that are stocked with toilet paper and bullets, the Bundy militia arrived in Oregon just to be told to go the hell home by the locals.Both the Hammond family who are at the center of this ruckus and local residents alike are critical of the Bundys  idiot militia being in their town. A lawyer for the Hammond family released a statement on the situation saying,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family.

 WATCH The Hilarious ‘Goodbye’ Video Posted By One Of Oregon’s Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Thus far, the Oregon militia members who have occupied the federal building of a wildlife reserve are facing absolutely no threat of action being taken against them by government officials. Nonetheless, at least one of them has admitted that  he actually went to join these domestic terrorists with the intention of dying in a standoff, and subsequent statements and actions have shown that the others are likely thinking along those same lines. For instance, at least one of the militiamen has actually taken the time to film and upload a goodbye video to his family and other loved ones. While the videos are serious and tearful to the right-wing loons, they are nothing short of hilarious to those of us who aren t completely insane. Here is the one from known domestic terrorist and Muslim hater Jon Ritzheimer: Honestly, if this loon cared about his children that much, he d realize that missing the entire holiday season for this nonsense is doing them a tremendous disservice. All in the name of  what? Wanting to be above the law? Wanting to die as some kind of  free man?  I don t think that means what he thinks it means.Take your meds and go home, Mr. Ritzheimer. Even if you don t die there, you ll likely spend a lengthy stretch of time in federal prison for these ridiculous antics. Either way, your children need you home, not out terrorizing and occupying government facilities. If you knew anything about being a good father, you d know that. Then again, those kids would be better off not being raised by such a loon anyway. Good luck to them, they ll need it.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Why The NRA Could Be In Big Trouble For Breaking Federal Law,"The National Rifle Association may be in violation of federal law, according to documents the NRA itself filed with the Internal Revenue Service.While the NRA often refers to itself as a membership organization with millions of members that contribute to its operations, they said something completely different on their tax forms.The NRA, which was founded in New York in 1871 and claims to have millions of members, even told the IRS it didn t receive membership dues, thus enabling it to avoid disclosing more about its activities. Last year, it spent $345 million.At the same time as this deceptive practice reportedly occurred the NRA also conveniently disappeared the existence of its political slush fund, the Political Victory Fund, the PAC the organization uses to target any and all politicians attempting to reduce gun violence, including President Obama.The forms the NRA signed omitting the existence of its PAC and membership status state that they must be truthfully signed under  penalties of perjury.  The NRA also ignored the box requiring that it disclose whether it engaged in lobbying   despite the NRA often flooding congressional offices with lobbyists seeking to flood neighborhoods with guns and ammunition. How that form wasn t intended to mislead the IRS, I don t know. I don t know how you come to any other conclusion,  said lawyer Marcus Owens, a former IRS official and leading expert on non-profit tax law.Unbelievably, the NRA told the IRS it hadn t spent any money on lobbying between 2008 and 2014. But the Manchin-Toomey gun bill, which the NRA opposed, came up in the U.S. Senate in 2013 in the months after the Sandy Hook gun massacre.Then when news organizations began pointing out these possibly illegal discrepancies, the NRA suddenly began adding information about its donation and lobbying efforts on its 2014 returns.According to the New York Post, NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman s office hasn t commented on whether the NRA is being investigated for its incomplete filings with the federal government. Schneiderman received widespread coverage for going after fantasy football providers Draft Kings and Fanduel, if he began criminally looking into the NRA it would create huge shockwaves across the world of politics.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Oregon Right-Wing Terrorist Makes CHILLING Confession: ‘I Came Here To Die’ (SCREENSHOTS),"If anyone questions whether or not the Bundy-led right-wing terrorists who violently took over  a federal building in Oregon are actually violent terrorists, they need only ask Capt. Moroni,  one of the reported more than 100 armed men who seized control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge over the weekend. Bundy s people demand nothing short of  complete surrender  of the land to the conservative terrorist cell, a move they allegedly made in support of two felons and arsonists who don t want their brand of  help. While some   like ABC and CNN   seek to downplay this  action,  the rest of us see it for what it is: the Stupid Part of America has finally mobilized its  militia  and is willing to  kill or be killed  to achieve their goals. Though early estimates have said 100 to 150 men were holding down the newly-established terrorist base, OPB s Amanda Peacher says that only a few dozen men are occupying the federal building. According to Peacher, federal employees were warned to steer clear of the wildlife refuge in a memo that reads: Our top concern is employee safety. All employees are accounted for, and the Refuge will be closed until further notice. Employees of all land management agencies in the area will operate from alternate worksites, telework, or administrative leave. No matter how many people are there, one man to whom Peacher spoke revealed that not only are the insurrectionists willing to use violence to accomplish their goals   but they are ready and willing to die in the process. A man who would identify himself only as  Capt. Moroni  told Peacher I didn t come here to shoot, I came here to die.  A series of tweets from Peacher detailed not only the chilling admission, but showed that the Bundy Army is already establishing supply lines to fuel their mini-revolution:          Since an unarmed demonstration by African-American protesters over the unjust killing of one or more black men attracts a heavily-armed force, surely law enforcement is responding heavily to this very real terrorist threat. There were no law enforcement agents visible in the area around the refuge. A man with a goatee beard and wraparound sunglasses stood guard, armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and refused entry to the federally owned facility,  writes The Guardian s Jason Wilson. One of the occupiers, who  declined to give his name or affiliation, citing  operational security,  confirmed that the heavily-armed men  would be camping on the site  because it s  public land  and they view themselves to be  The People. It s time we stop coddling right-wing extremists. If they want a war, let s give them one. It will be short-lived.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Hillary Clinton Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker Rudely Heckling Her At Town Hall Event (VIDEO),"A Republican lawmaker in New Hampshire showed up to one of Hillary Clinton s town hall events in the state on Sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle Mrs. Clinton. Bad idea. Not only did it not work out as planned, but the former Secretary of State called out the state representative in front of everyone. You are very rude, and I m not ever going to call on you. Thank you. The comment earned Mrs. Clinton an enormous round of applause, as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at Hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person. It s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well. Perhaps there s a better way to get your message across?So, what exactly was Katherine Prudhomme O Brien, the GOP state representative from Rockingham, trying to say? She followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that Hillary didn t want to talk about Bill Clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago. Really? That s what was so important? I asked her how in the world she can say that Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Wiley are lying when she has no idea who Juanita Broderick is. She told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is. How can she access that they are lying, which she told someone last month? Expect for more below-the-belt tactics like these now that Bill Clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on Monday. Republicans are looking for any and every chance to use Bill s past indiscretions against Hillary. It s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics, yet somehow they still get the most attention.With that said, Bernie Sanders, unlike Republicans, doesn t intend on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual past anytime soon: No, I think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton s sex life.

 Texas Governor Directs Violent Threat At President Obama On Twitter (TWEET),"The lack of respect for the office of the President of the United States from Republicans is utterly appalling. No matter who the president is, or how much you disagree with their policy proposals or how they conduct business, you respect the office. You don t have the respect the person, but you respect the role they play as the leader of the nation. However, Republicans seem to have forgotten this unwritten rule, especially under the presidency of Barack Obama. Their utter disrespect borders on utter impudence.For the last seven years we ve even had members of the right-wing say that President Obama wasn t born in the United States. It s as if they don t consider him valid as a president, so they don t need to offer him the respect and dignity the office of the presidency so rightly deserves.Yet another example of this insolence can be found in a recent tweet by the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott.Abbott, upset that President Obama wants to curb the epidemic of gun violence after mass shootings have become all too common in occurrence, decided that he would directly threaten the president.What did the president say that got Abbott s Underoos in a bunch? A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I ll meet with our attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale. You know, because God forbid we, as a nation, care enough to curb the epidemic of gun violence.However, Abbott takes it personally, and pandering to his base of voters and the right-wing lunatics who feel they should be able to own their personal arsenal to cater to their paranoia, he tweets this at President Obama:Obama wants to impose more gun control. My response.#? COME & TAKE IT @NRA #tcot #PJNET https://t.co/RUPbcev5jY pic.twitter.com/8VNwisj966  Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) January 1, 2016And, of course, this tween is also directed at the NRA, because Abbott feels the need to whine like the immature child that he presents himself to be, and needs them to help him fight his selfish battles.What Abbott, and all the other right-wing loons need to realize is, when you say,  COME AND TAKE IT  to the president of the United States with a picture of a gun or cannon, as the case may be, you are threatening the President of the United States.  Come and take it  implies you are willing to kill to have your way. You take your argument of clear dissent to that of a direct threat of violence against the president for wanting to impose policy you disagree with.Abbott also needs to realize that Texas is only a state, not its own nation, and they are to abide by the laws of the United States, and any action taken by President Obama. Otherwise, they are in clear violation of the U.S. Constitution.These words from Abbott need to be called what they are   a threat, and Abbott needs to held accountable. As the governor of one of the largest states in the U.S. he should have a little more maturity than this, act like an adult, and apologize. You don t have to agree with the president, but you need to respect the office.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Why Is The ‘Y’all Qaeda’ Militia Being Mostly Ignored By Law Enforcement?,"They re calling them  Y all Qaeda.  It s all at once appropriate and ridiculous. The fact that a group of armed traitors are occupying a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge shouldn t be treated as a cute internet meme, but there it is.Rather, this is serious business made more serious by the infuriating reality that local law enforcement appears to be allowing it to happen without much interference.According to The Oregonian, police officers were nowhere to be found during the Saturday rally at the site which led to several members seizing the headquarters at the refuge. Furthermore, law enforcement hasn t revealed its plans   if any   to repel the militia from the government land. And now that Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada secessionist ranched Cliven Bundy, has taken over as the leader of the occupation, the militiamen are sure to be joined by more attention-seeking seditionists.But going back to the lack of law enforcement presence. Do we really need to underscore the lopsided injustice here? Do we really need to emphasize the fact that if this had been Black Lives Matter activists or, hell, Islamic terrorists, how the facility would ve been surrounded and the situation greeted with law enforcement gunfire. If just one African-American gunman has stepped foot into the building, recent history and more than enough video footage has proved that the black gunman would ve been decimated in an onslaught of police gunfire. Full stop.Instead, a group of secessionist weekend warriors with enough disposable income to play military dress-em-up are being allowed to seize government property   taxpayer-owned land and facilities   in an effort to exert their independence from the rest of the nation, law enforcement appears to be completely blas  about it. Why? The answer should be obvious.So, what next? If these bastards want a fight, and if they want to die for their stupid cause, give it to them. They ve seized our land. Mine. Yours. It s time to stop dicking around and show them they re not above the law just because of their white privilege.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 3, 2016"
 CNN Analyst: White Militia Are Not A Threat Because They Are Not ‘Looting Anything’ (VIDEO),"People have been quick to point out that there is a clear double standard in the media and people s attitudes regarding the armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Oregon. CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick gave a blatant example of this double standard when he appeared on a broadcast of CNN s, in this case, dubiously titled Reliable Sources, on Sunday.During the segment, Roderick made the case that the militia members occupying the federal building are not  looting anything  which makes them way less of a threat to people s safety than say, Black Lives Matters protestors. The last thing we need is some type of large confrontation because that s when stuff goes bad,  Roderick explained.  And I think in this particular instance, if we just wait them out, see what they ve got to say, then eventually, they re all going to go home. CNN host Brian Stelter was quick to point out that some have said that if,  [These were] Black Lives Matter protesters, or if these were peaceful Muslim Americans, they would be treated very differently by law enforcement. This is a very rural area,  Roderick responds.  It is out in the middle of nowhere. What are they actually doing? They re not destroying property; they re not looting anything. It s important to remember that in the United States,  rural  means white, and  urban  means black. I mean, there s a whole separate situation going on as to exactly why they re there and that will be worked out through the legal process,  he continued.  But I think now that they ve taken over this location out at the fish and wildlife, this brings in the federal side. And I know the federal government has learned over the years how to deal with these types of incidences. Let s face it, we all know if a Black Lives Matter group of protesters, or any group that isn t legitimized by the white supremacist narrative of the right wing, was to do the same thing as these wannabe revolutionary cowboys are doing, they would have been demonized in the press and probably killed outright by federal authorities. No one was calling for  calmer heads  when police beat the hell out of BLM protesters.You can watch the segment below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Texas Lt. Governor Uses Fake Statistics To Defend New Open Carry Law (VIDEO),"The Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, appeared on Meet The Press with Chuck Todd on Sunday to discuss his state s new open carry law. Now, while we must say Mr. Patrick did a pretty good job at making it seem like he defended the merits of the law, in reality, all he did was provide outdated, heavily debunked statistics.Here s what Dan Patrick had to say about the relation of guns to crime data: Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There s a study showing that where states have open carry, or concealed carry, but particulary open carry, crime is down 25%, murders are down (even). Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing. In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass-shootings except two in America since 1950 have been gun-free zones. Where people have guns, bad guys don t go. Lt. Governor Patrick doesn t cite his source in the interview, but given how he just said open carry causes crime to go down 25%, we re going to assume he s referring to Florida State Rep. Matt Gaetz s (R-Fort Walton Beach) research. Matt Gaetz is the guy who came up with all this from when he sponsored a bill in October to allow open carry in his state.During a press conference, he claimed to show research that proved violent crime was  23 percent lower in states that allowed open carry, and the murder rate was 5 percent lower.  There are just a few problems with this. Politifact decided to fact-check this and determined that it was very misleading. For one, Gaetz only used data for one full year (not very historical by any means) and compiled it in such a manner that would make it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion from. It noted that no policy makers should rely on it. Yes, anyone can come up with stats, but that doesn t make them applicable. If a policy maker were to try then and use these stats to make the claim that this proves open carry laws make people safer, then that deserves the title of fake.Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck doesn t think you can use just one statistic to back up a claim when several other studies are proving otherwise. Plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding having no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other. And, not only that but the opposite appears to be true. The Washington Post published an article entitled: More gun, more crime: New research debunks central thesis of the gun rights movement. In it, it points out how Stanford law professor John Donohue has advanced decades of analysis showing that guns do in fact equal more crime. So much for the Texas Lt. Governor s argument that we need more guns to be safe. I guess this is what you get when you pick and choose your facts, heavily debunked ones at that.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Chris Christie Calls Obama A ‘Petulant Child’ For Executive Orders On Guns (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama has recently announced that he will be issuing executive orders on guns after a series of horrific attacks involving firearms. Predictably, the NRA and Republicans are absolutely freaking out over this, and one of the outspoken GOPers whining about this just happens to be Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.During an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Christie criticized Obama for trying to improve gun control laws, calling him a  boy  for trying to keep the American people safe from terrorism and violence within the home.When Fox moderator Chris Wallace asked Christie what he thought about Obama s intention to expand background checks and prevent guns from getting into the hands of accused domestic abusers and terrorists, Christie went off on a rant: This President is a petulant child. Whenever he can t get what he wants, because frankly, the American people have rejected his agenda by turning over the House and the Senate to republicans, going from 21 Republican governors when he came into office, now 31, now he wants to act as a king. The fact is if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to congress and convince congress they re necessary, but this is going to be another illegal executive action which I m sure will be rejected by the courts. When I become president, they will be stricken from executive action by executive action I will take. You can watch Christie go off on Obama below: Christie had no issue criticizing Obama, even though he is unaware of what Obama will actually do, or the potential legality of those actions. The crazy thing is, Christie later said that he is FOR the restriction on guns to terror watch suspects, but isn t comfortable with Obama taking immediate, responsible action! Wallace pointed out that Christie had previously been supportive of gun control measures, and asked him if he d changed his stance. Christie said: I haven t changed my tune. I signed the bill that banned guns for people on the terror watch list. As president, I would make sure that terror watch list was actually accurate. Interestingly enough, Republicans are fine when Obama takes executive action for things like bombing Syria   however when it comes to protecting women from their abusers or stopping terrorists from getting guns, they ve proven time after time that it s just not a priority.Tomorrow, Obama will see Attorney General Loretta Lynch to finalize his proposal. A town hall will be held on Thursday, and the new executive actions on background checks are expected in the next few days. Featured image via Marc Nozell / Flickr",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Bernie Sanders Calls Out Trump Over His Obsession With Bill Clinton’s Sex Life (VIDEO),"During a segment on ABC s This Week, Bernie Sanders hammered Donald Trump for talking about Bill Clinton s sex life rather than the real issues that the United States should be focusing on.The show s host, Martha Raddatz, brought the subject up, asking Sanders if he thought that Bill Clinton s sex life should be considered  fair game  during the election.: Donald Trump and Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus think Bill Clinton s sexual history is fair game. Do you? No, I don t,  Sanders replied, and then continued: I think, you know, we have enormous problems facing this country and I think we got more things to worry about than Bill Clinton s sexual life. I think   interestingly enough, maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change, understand that climate change is not a hoax, as he believes that it is, that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country, which he opposes, and maybe we should not be giving huge tax breaks to fellow billionaires like Donald Trump. So I think maybe he should focus on those things,  Sanders concluded.Sanders made a similar critique of Trump last week. Sanders claimed that he could win over Trump supporters. That claim must have scared the hell out of Trump. In less than 24 hours, Trump responded to Bernie Sanders, saying that he is in support of raising wages. That s a complete flip from Trump s earlier claims that wages in the United States are too high. Of course, Trump called him a liar and acted like a complete douche bag about the whole thing. Trump still insists that he doesn t think that the minimum wage should be raised, but statements he made in Politico show that he is playing defense on the issue.Bernie Sanders got the Republican presidential primary runner to flip his script and adopt a more progressive message on a major issue. So who knows, maybe sometime this week Trump will go all in on the importance of fighting climate change? Sanders has become a force to be reckoned with because of his unrelenting commitment to his platform.

 Teen Records Himself Abusing Girl: ‘This Is What You Do When People Act Up’ (VIDEO),"A young man recorded himself as he maliciously abused a young woman, apparently his girlfriend. He then uploaded the video to the internet. The man, who appears to be in his mid-to-late teens, seems to think that his horrific treatment of the girl in the video is either funny or cool.The 34-second video shows the male seated behind the wheel of his car. The first thing he says is,  I just don t want people to act up. The girl is standing outside the vehicle, her arms folded across her chest in a protective stance.By the five second mark it becomes obvious that he has her trapped by the hair, which is rolled up in the window of the car.At this point he explains, clearly amused with himself, that this is exactly what he has done. Pull her hair through the window,  he says.  Roll the window up. He then laughs as he begins to put the car into gear.The young woman is clearly terrified, and begins to beat on the window of the car. The driver laughs harder, as she becomes more visibly frightened by his behavior, pleading with him to  Stop, stop. He continues to laugh, saying something that sounds like it could be the girl s name,  Jenny,  repeatedly.Watch the 34-second video below, via LiveLeak.https://youtu.be/SF0s9ycMi9oThe video appears to have been uploaded anonymously. The young man who did this needs to be named and shamed. Not only that, but the video needs to be turned over to police, so that they can arrest him on charges of domestic abuse.In most states, if the police have sufficient evidence to believe that domestic abuse has occurred, they do not need the victim to cooperate or press charges, in order to arrest the perpetrator.The young woman in this video may well be too afraid of what this abuser will do if she reports him.Domestic violence is defined as  a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. The actions of the perpetrator in this video are clearly designed to terrify this young girl. By his own admission, he s using terror-tactics to control her behavior or keep her from  acting up. One in four U.S. women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. Two out of every three female homicide victims are killed during an act of domestic violence.The perpetrator and victim in this video happen to be Black. But research shows that domestic violence impacts women from all walks of life, regardless of race, ethnicity, or economic circumstances.While Black women between the ages of 20 and 24 are more likely to experience domestic violence than white women, in all other age groups, Black women and white women experience domestic violence at an equal rate. So before you even start to imply that the couple s race has something to do with it, don t. Domestic violence is not an issue that is confined to any race.While the couple in this video may appear to be young, women between the ages of 16 and 24 years are most likely to be victims of intimate partner abuse.Domestic violence is everyone s problem. Between 2003 and 2012, domestic violence accounted for more than 20 percent of all violent crimes in the U.S. It costs society $37 billion annually in law enforcement involvement, legal work, medical and mental health treatment, and lost productivity.While the perpetrator in the above video is unidentified at this time, the internet has a way of finding people out.What if the young lady in this video was your daughter, sister or friend?Our society needs to send a clear message that this kind of terror-inducing behavior is not funny and it is certainly not cool. This is a sadistic crime, and the young man that committed it needs to be held accountable for his actions.",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Professional Panderer Carly Fiorina Says Ted Cruz Will Say Anything To Get Elected (VIDEO),"Just days after forsaking her Stanford Cardinals by supporting the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Rose Bowl to pander for votes, Carly Fiorina complained that Ted Cruz says  whatever  to get elected.During an interview on CNN, Fiorina launched an attack on the Texas Tea Party hero, who is currently leading in some Iowa polls ahead of the first primary vote in February. The failed former CEO of Hewlett-Packard whined about Cruz saying whatever it takes to get voters to support him. Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa. He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he s going to do as he pleases. I think the American people are tired of the political class that promises much and delivers much of the same. But as right as she is about Ted Cruz, Fiorina completely ignored her own hypocrisy when it comes to pandering.For weeks, Fiorina pandered to conservative  Christians  by claiming that heavily edited Planned Parenthood videos featured footage of a live fetus being butchered for body parts. Fiorina s claims have since been thoroughly debunked by media and medical professionals.She has also pandered to women by falsely claiming that  92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama s first term belonged to women,  when in fact, women actually gained jobs.Fiorina also pandered to the military by accusing President Obama of ending the careers of several generals. However, only two of the five she mentioned retired due to policy differences with their commander-in-chief.Time and time again, Fiorina has lied in an effort to gain support. Politifact has caught her lying around 70 percent of the time.But her worst attempt to pander came on Friday when she wrote a Twitter post rooting for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team against her own alma mater in a clear effort to gain support from Iowa voters.Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today. #RoseBowl  Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 1, 2016CNN host Dana Bash also pointed out Fiorina s hypocrisy on Sunday, to which Fiorina responded by claiming that the tweet was just her way of having a little fun and was not meant to pander at all. For heaven s sake. Can t a girl ever have a little bit of fun?  Fiorina asked. That was a tongue in cheek tweet which the people of Iowa understand, because I was asked over and over again in Iowa, having attended a Hawkeye tailgate, I was asked, they knew that my heart was torn. Let s just say if the biggest mistake I make is a tongue in cheek Tweet about a Rose Bowl, the American people will sleep safely when I am President of the United States,  she added.  It was tongue in cheek, for heaven s sake. A girl needs to have a little fun sometimes. I guess it was a slow news day in the media. Here s the video via YouTube.However, contrary to what Fiorina claims, Iowa fans, nor anyone else for that matter, did not understand and were definitely not happy about Fiorina s tweet as she was roundly criticized in reply after reply to her tweet.Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, Fiorina s tweet is not the only mistake she has made throughout her campaign, nor is it the biggest. And it should also be noted that Fiorina played the woman card to spin out of her Twitter fiasco. Rather than own up to her obvious pandering play, Fiorina framed it as a girl just having fun and suggested that the media is being sexist.Sorry, Carly. But that just doesn t fly. You are currently polling at 2 percent in Iowa. Clearly, you are desperate for higher poll numbers as it becomes ever more clear that your campaign is doomed. So, you made a choice to pander to Iowans by throwing your own team under a bus instead of displaying loyalty to the university you graduated from. And then your decision was made worse after Stanford absolutely destroyed Iowa on the football field to win the Rose Bowl. If any other team had been playing the Hawkeyes, perhaps your tweet would have been appropriate, but that was not the case. You got caught pandering and now you re trying to frame it as a girl having a little fun and an evil sexist media attacking you for it. That s called playing the victim and it s not very appealing to voters either.Carly Fiorina should be so embarrassed right now that she ends her campaign in disgrace instead of continuing to pretend that people actually like her and that she has a chance to actually win.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Poll Finds White Republicans Are Angry Nearly All The Time,"In a new poll that asked Americans to comment on their anger issues, Republicans and white people reported being angry nearly all the time.Perhaps stoked by hate-mongering organizations like Fox News and right-wing radio, a large portion of conservative white people said they got enraged over current events at least once a day, and many felt that they were angrier now than they were just one year ago.Overall, 49 percent of Americans said they find themselves feeling angrier now about current events than they were one year ago. Whites are the angriest, with 54 percent saying they have grown more outraged over the past year. That s more than Latinos (43 percent) and African-Americans (33 percent).Seventy-three percent of whites said they get angry at least once per day, compared with 66 percent of Hispanics and 56 percent of blacks.The poll also found Republicans are angrier than Democrats. Sixty-one percent of Republicans say current events irk them more today than a year ago, compared to 42 percent of Democrats.The poll, while not exactly scientific, does reinforce earlier research that found white, conservative Americans feel they are more oppressed than any other group. Oftentimes, this anxiety is  explicitly about not coming to grips with a black president.Peter Brimelow, author of  Alien Nation: Common Sense About America s Immigration Disaster,  asserts that much of white America s anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics.Diversity, he says,  is not strength. The Tea Party is a response to this emerging white fear. Conservative politicians, sensing an opportunity, seized hold of those anxieties and exploited them for votes. It was also impossible to contain. The hatred and fear-mongering on the right has turned into an uncontrollable inferno. The results are toxic new realities like Donald Trump s popularity and   more recently   the armed takeover of a federally owned wildlife reserve by right-wing extremists who think paying grazing fees for their cattle is tyranny.On the face of things, Americans should have less to be angry about. Conservatives may not like it, but the economy has roared back to life under Obama. More Americans have health insurance than at any time in history. Social injustices that have long plagued the country are finally being reckoned with. Crime, in large part, is down.What s left is the shrieking, hollow screams from pundits and politicians who desperately need you to stay mad. The Tea Party was an utter disaster, and many of its beneficiaries have been booted out of office by voters with a Tea Party hangover, but its initial surge of racist, xenophobic rage proved to many that  voting angry  is a legitimate   if pathetic   electoral strategy. And as America approaches its next election, it s clear that they are madder than ever.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 3, 2016"

This seditious behavior is quite illegal, and the United States Constitution explicitly states that a well regulated militia can be used against insurrections, not in the allowance of such horrific behavior.In Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, it states: To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; The founders use of civilian militias was not one to  overthrow  the government if citizens felt they were being wronged, it was to protect the union from insurrectionists who were a threat to the nation.How did they make sure these militias were well regulated and armed in case of insurrection, invasion, or to maintain the law of the land? With this thing called the Second Amendment: A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. See how everything pieces together when you don t just cherry pick the parts of the Constitution you want to make sure every dimwitted Tom, Dick or Sally is armed to the teeth. The purpose of the militias was to protect the newly formed government. And while dissent is patriotic, sedition is not. If you don t like how the government is being run, we have this glorious thing in the United States called  democracy  and we re able to vote for who writes our laws.What s happening in Oregon, by definition, is exactly treason. It could also be considered a  Seditious conspiracy. If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both. These  patriots  need to be locked up for a good long time.If you still question the intent of the Founding Fathers  effort to thwart insurrection, please take note of the Whiskey Rebellion. Not much unlike what s happening in Oregon with pissed off farmers, the government imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which these farmers decided to rebel against. Well, President George Washington called forth the use of the militia to stop the insurrection and this refusal to follow the law. In fact, here is the transcript of his proclamation from September 25, 1794: Whereas, from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution and laws of the United States, in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania, would yield to time and reflection, I thought it sufficient, in the first instance, rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody them; but the moment is now come, when the overtures of forgiveness, with no other condition than a submission to law, have been only partially accepted; when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government has been adopted, without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury, and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy, endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support, and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is manifest, that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at defiance, the contest being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole Union, and, at the expense of those who desire peace, indulge a desperate ambition;Now, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, in obedience to that high and irresistible duty, consigned to me by the Constitution,  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed;  deploring that the American name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government; commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved, in perfect reliance on that gracious Providence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country, to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the laws; do hereby declare and make known, that, with a satisfaction which can be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received intelligence of their patriotic alacrity, in obeying the call of the present, though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force, which, according to every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency, is already in motion to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confided or shall confide in the protection of Government, shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity, will be treated with the most liberal good faith, if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct, and that instructions are given accordingly.And I do, moreover, exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men, to contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those crimes, which produce this resort to military coercion; to check, in their respective spheres, the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth, and their discontents in the place of stable government; and to call to mind, that as the people of the United States have been permitted, under the Divine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, in an enlightened age, to elect their own Government, so will their gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain the Constitution and the laws.And, lastly, I again warn all persons, whomsoever and whersoever, not to abet, aid, or comfort the insurgents aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at their peril; and I do also require all officers and other citizens, according to their several duties, as far as may be in their power, to bring under the cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises. If there were such a thing as a  mic drop  in the day, it would have hit the floor with the strength of a thunderous boom.Honestly? Washington s words could be said today in the same regard to the thousands of armed wannabe  patriots  who are taking up arms against the nation in wrongful insurrection. These men in Oregon need to be stopped, they need to be arrested, and this sort of behavior, in any way, cannot be condoned or allowed. It goes against everything we are as the United States of America.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Here Are The Right-Wing Scumbags The Bundy Militiamen Say They’ll Kill People To Protect,"When the tense standoff between federal agents and a group of right-wing extremists at Cliven Bundy s ranch ended in a stalemate, it was only a matter of time before we heard from the emboldened  patriots  again. On January 2, they showed up unannounced   and unwelcome   in Oregon.Towing with them a large arsenal of weapons and vowing to die in a shoot out if police or federal agents removed them, Cliven s sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy seized a federal wildlife building and said they were prepared to stay there indefinitely until their demands   the unconditional surrender of the United States government and the ceding of federal land to ranchers like the Bundy family   are met. It s clear that Ammon Bundy, the ringleader, wants to build an army. In a statement, he begged fellow anti-government patriots to  stand up and come to Harney County. We need your help and we are asking for it. And the Bundy family made no secret of the violence underlining the  protest. I talked to Ryan Bundy on the phone again. He said they're willing to kill and be killed if necessary. #OregonUnderAttack  Ian Kullgren (@IanKullgren) January 3, 2016While Ammon has framed the issue as one of freedom vs. tyranny, the real reason they showed up was to protect two Oregon ranchers, father and son Dwight and Steven Hammond. Like Cliven Bundy, the Hammonds had gotten used to abusing public lands to feed their livestock on and felt that it was now their  right  to do so.Who are the Hammonds? Based on their actions: A pair of scumbags who were willing to destroy a large area of federally protected land just to protect themselves from being exposed as criminals.In 2001, they purposely set a series of wildfires on government land in order to hide their poaching activities. The fires turned into a raging inferno that nearly killed a few local residents, destroyed 139 acres of public land and killed countless animals that were meant to be safe.The jury convicted both of the Hammonds of using fire to destroy federal property for a 2001 arson known as the Hardie-Hammond Fire, located in the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Area.  Witnesses at trial, including a relative of the Hammonds, testified the arson occurred shortly after Steven Hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on BLM property.  Jurors were told that Steven Hammond handed out  Strike Anywhere  matches with instructions that they be lit and dropped on the ground because they were going to  light up the whole country on fire. These are the people Bundy s armed militia group came to Oregon to defend. They would set a deadly wildfire to protect themselves and ruin the land for anyone else because  freedom.  If the definition of terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation to achieve a political goal, then let s call this what it is: Terrorism.Ironically, the Hammonds themselves want nothing to do with the standoff. Their lawyer disavowed the group from the start. The Hammonds are already facing jail sentences for their crimes. They ve correctly guessed that adding  stoking an armed insurrection  would only keep them in jail longer.From interviews Ammon Bundy has given while in Oregon, it s clear that he has an idea of himself as a right-wing martyr. As such, he and his fellow group of anti-government terrorists are clearly willing to die for their cause. They ve brought with them enough guns to see that they take down as many innocent people as they can before that happens.So far, federal agencies and the Harney County Sheriff s Department are taking a light approach the the occupation. Not keen to start another Waco, the authorities are trying to reason with the group rather than go in shooting. It remains to be seen whether a group that invaded a small wildlife reserve building while wearing camo fatigues and carrying rifles can be reasoned with.Feature image via CBC screengrab",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Fox News Defends The Confederacy After Right-Wing Militia Seizes Federal Building (VIDEO),"Hours after right-wing militia members committed treason against the United States, Fox News defended the Confederacy and the Confederate flag.Fox and Friends host Tucker Carlson declared that attacking the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism is an assault on middle America during the Sunday morning broadcast.Carlson took particular issue with director Quentin Tarantino s recent remarks on the subject, in which he said,  I ve always felt the rebel flag was some American swastika. This caused Carlson to fly into a rage against the the Hateful Eight director before going on to defend the flag and the Confederacy. I don t think he knows anything about the Confederacy,  the Fox host said.  I would be shocked if Quentin Tarantino could name three Civil War battles if his life depended on it. This is an attack by the elites on middle American culture. Using the Confederacy and the battle flag and all that stuff, they re just symbols to them of what they believe is the backward culture between Malibu and Georgetown. It s like they look out and, man, everyone is in the Klan. You know, they eat pork rinds, they watch NASCAR, they re horrible. Co-host Clayton Morris pointed out that Nazis and American white supremacists both use the Confederate flag as a symbol of their racist and anti-government views, which seemed to cause Carlson to step back for a moment to claim that he isn t defending the flag even though that s what he was doing the entire time. He also claimed that he doesn t support armed rebellion against the government. But, of course, Carlson concluded by trying to enrage conservatives enough to the point where they might become even more violent against the government. I would say that [Tarantino] is not making a reasonable point here. He s making the point that the president always makes, that the real threat is middle America. They have too many guns, they re into this Christianity thing. They are opposed to abortion. They have all kinds of Medieval views that are a threat to America. It really is an attack on middle American culture. Here s the video via YouTube.As right-wing militias continue to become more emboldened, conservative media appears to be supportive of their actions. After all, Carlson and his co-hosts only devoted about 15 seconds to covering an armed attack on the United States government while focusing much more time on defending the losers of the Civil War who tried to overthrow the United States via armed rebellion. Clearly, these thugs in Oregon need to be arrested and locked away from civilized society and Fox News should be shut down for trying to anger more people into supporting violence against government.Because that s exactly what they are doing by claiming that the government thinks people in middle America are a threat. They are trying to gin up fundamentalist Christians, anti-abortion fanatics, and gun nuts into getting angry enough to start shooting and committing acts of terrorism that will get people killed. It s one thing to have a conservative point of view, but what Fox News is doing now looks an awful lot like support for treason and terrorism.Featured Image: Tumblr",News,"January 3, 2016"
" Pres. Obama Starts 2016 With A Huge Win: Iran Turns Over Nuclear Program, GOP Silenced"," The Nuclear Deal  became a Republican talking point as soon as it became inevitable that the Obama administration was going to move forward and try to do what no Democrat or Republican could do for 30 years: tell the Iranians to sit down and do as they re told so people can stop finding reasons to bomb each other.We were told from the beginning that Iran wasn t suddenly a friendly nation. We were told flat out that they support terrorism and that they have human rights issues and women s rights issues and all kinds of things to sort out. All of that being true is also the reason we couldn t just sit back and allow a potentially unpredictable rogue nuclear nation to decide to eliminate a neighbor, friend or foe.You see, we can t just have people nuking each other. When the deal was made the GOP immediately called it a giveaway. They rang up the total of how much the Iranian economy   and therefore its people   would gain with sanctions lifted and called that number the amount Obama was  giving to terrorists.  The amount of enriched product Iran would have left would be enough to kill Israel 50 times. They spewed lie after lie to make people afraid   it s what they do   of the very thought of Iran having anything nuclear at all within its borders.The Republican plan is simple: keep the sanctions on Iran, making them as helpless as possible on the oil market, and then start a war. It s just the next inevitable Republican War. If we elect a Republican president we can pretty much bank on it. Several candidates have said they would  tear up the deal  on their first day in office.Unfortunately for the GOP, Iran just surrendered its entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians. What little material they have left will be downgraded to fissionable reactor plates for an internationally supervised test reactor with zero capability of producing weapons-grade material.The transfer included tons of low-grade material that could have potentially been enriched along with the entire inventory of enriched uranium the Iranians possessed. At this point, the Iranians are reduced to a pre-nuclear industrial era where the only thing nuclear reactors do are experiments.That s what the people who listen to the voices of doom on stage at GOP debates don t get. There never was any way for Iran to get out of the stipulations of the deal. Their path to a nuclear weapon was cut off at the knees. This latest step to full implementation is yet another incredible win for a president who refuses to allow his legacy to die during his  lame duck  years.Featured image via Instagram",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Donald Trump Rings In The New Year With A Vicious Twitter Rampage (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s insane ways are no longer surprising but have become very predictable. He rung in the new year with yet more Trump negativity and the usual antics we ve all become accustomed to. Unabashed, like a spoiled baby that constantly gets reinforcement from the few people that actually like him, Trump went on another tantrum that he thinks will garner him yet more support. He let loose on his Republican opponent Jeb Bush and on Hillary Clinton. Take a look at his Twitter posts. First comes his rant against his Republican rival, the squirmy Jeb Bush:.@JebBush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016I don t know about this one. George Bush takes the cake for the biggest embarrassment, not only to his family, but to the nation. After all, he s a certified war criminal. As Americans, we have to constantly explain how we elected him once in the first place. Yes, once. His daddy helped him steal the first election.The next rant comes against former president Bill Clinton. Harking on allegations that he s a sexist, Trump immediately took the opportunity to attack Hillary by going after Bill:I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016Low blow by Trump. After all, Bill s escapades have nothing to do with Hillary. In fact, one can argue that she s shown both class and courage in the face of her husband s alleged extra-marital affairs.Here s another attack on Hillary. This time it s against her alliance with Israel:Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016This one is difficult to argue. The bipartisan support for anything Israel is quite disturbing. Trump is referencing Israel s illegal apartheid wall that has made islands of Palestinian towns and villages, cutting them off from each other and creating a situation in the West Bank that South African anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu has said is worse than anything he witnessed under the white regime that exploited blacks for decades. We know how that system crashed, so the hope is that Hillary can change her ways and be on the side of justice and help end Israel s crazy experiment. Former president Jimmy Carter even wrote a book about Israel s insanity.However, Trump gets no credit for this tweet since he s advocating a similar approach for Muslims in the United States and he s arguing that Hillary is a hypocrite since she supports walling the Palestinians, the majority of whom are Muslims (a large Christian Palestinian population including Bethlehem is walled as well).Donald Trump has received lots attention not only from his supporters but from those opposed to his stances. He s an expert at generating attention by entertaining people. But, just like a long running sitcom that slowly yet surely fades, many people are looking forward to the day when Trump is canceled.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 3, 2016"
 43-Year-Old Virgin With Bionic Penis Set To Have Sex For First Time (VIDEO),"A 43-year-old man with a surgically implanted bionic penis is set to actually use it  for the first time. Mohammed Abad, from Edinburgh, will take the life changing step next week with 35-year-old sex worker Charlotte Rose after they get to know each other when they go on a dinner date in London. Abad lost his organ as a result of a freak road side accident and was fitted with a bionic one that apparently allows him to perform. Abad said: I have waited long enough for this   it ll be a great start to the new year. My penis is working perfectly now so I just want to do it. I m really excited. I can t wait for it to finally happen.  [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nQF39iUyYg]When he was six, Abad was pushed into a road and fell under a moving car which dragged him 600 feet resulting in serious injuries, including to his genitals. He was fitted with a bionic replacement in 2012 but it s only been fully functional since 2015, when surgeons performed a special operation which will apparently allow him to have intercourse. Here is how the device works: The sexual device contains two tubes which fill up using liquid from his stomach, allowing him to maintain an erection. The contraption   complete with  on  and  off  buttons in his testicles to pump it up or deflate it   was made from the flesh of his arm and fitted by surgeons at University College London. It has a button in his testicles which he can press to pump it up, as well as another button which drains the penis after use, so it deflates. Here is how the gadget was attached: Molding and attaching it took three years, with doctors from University College London using a skin graft from his arm to line its shaft. The skin and fat from his forearm was removed to create the new penis, which was then attached during an 11-hour operation. Along with giving him a sex life it has also allowed him to pass urine standing up for the first time. It took surgeons at University College London three years to mold Mohammed Abad s new penis using skin taken from his arm. However, it wasn t that simple. Abad said that he s had some complications as a result of the surgery: I got out of hospital on the 10th of July and got a train back up to Scotland. I had to keep it erect for two weeks. I had to do that for it to heal, because that s the way it works. My old penis didn t go to waste   my surgeon used it to make my scrotum. In the last three years, Abad has had 119 operations. But that s not stopping him. His soon-to-be partner Charlotte Rose, who s a campaigner for sexual freedom and a dominatrix, said that that she is  honored  that Abad picked her and that she will not charge him. Abed, who was married for over two years, never told his wife that he didn t have a penis until their wedding night. She would later leave him. Rose said that she hopes that Abad will have more confidence after he loses his virginity.Hopefully everything will work out for Abad and he can be on his way to living a normal life.",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Why The Hell Are Our News Media Whitewashing Domestic Terrorism In Oregon?,"We all rely on the media every day to know what s going on in our world. Many media sources these days have an opinion informing the content they provide, but the majority usually try to avoid outright lying about things. That doesn t seem to be the case in what s happening right now in Oregon.There is an ongoing armed insurrectionist seizure of a federal building happening at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in Oregon. Depending on what news source you rely on for your  facts , you might be unaware of the reality of the situation.To bring you up to speed: Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, lit fires in an attempt to protect some of their property from invasive plant species. They ended up burning federal land   twice. Their actions netted them an eventual conviction for arson, which they served time for. After they were released, their sentences from a previous judge were found to be illegal   due to them being too short for the minimum sentencing requirements   and they were sent back to jail for longer sentences. The second conviction is what set off the protests, and caused Cliven Bundy s idiot militia to take up arms. To be fair, the Hammonds never asked anybody for help, especially not the Bundys.Here is where this all takes an incredibly weird turn. Many media outlets have been picking up this story, but the major ones are pants-on-fire lying about the event.Below is an excerpt from the Fox News reporting of the situation. Remember, Fox News  article published at 12:00 midnight at the earliest:Some local residents feared the Saturday rally would involve more than speeches, flags and marching. But the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs, flowers and pennies.As marchers reached the courthouse, they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door. Their message: civilians were buying back their government. After the march passed, two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies.A few blocks away, Hammond and his wife Susan greeted marchers, who planted flower bouquets in the snow. They sang some songs, Hammond said a few words, and the protesters marched back to their cars.Dwight Hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.Source: Fox NewsBelow are excerpts from Oregon Live. This is the exact story Fox News credited at the bottom of their article for the information in their reporting. Oregon Live s story was posted with the updates on weapons and threats of violence at 9:15 pm and again at 12:00 am:In phone interviews from inside the occupied building Saturday night, Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan Bundy, said they are not looking to hurt anyone. But they would not rule out violence if police tried to remove them, they said. The facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds,  Ammon Bundy said. We re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,  he added.  This is not a decision we ve made at the last minute. Neither man would say how many people are in the building or whether they are armed. Ryan Bundy said there were no hostages, but the group is demanding that the Hammonds be released and the federal government relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest.He said many would be willing to fight   and die, if necessary   to defend what they see as constitutionally protected rights for states, counties and individuals to manage local lands.Source: Oregonlive.comBelow is a video of Oregon Live s local news coverage   The people walking around in combat gear carrying long rifles seems to be too nuanced for ABC, AP or Fox News to notice:Many people have been calling out Fox for their total bullsh*t coverage on twitter:@FoxNews You misspelled ""Armed Christian terrorists.""

All three news sites credited the local news but chose not to report what the local news actually said, even mischaracterizing it from social media. This was not a journalistic mistake. This was corporate media propaganda.

 Racists Go CRAZY after Samuel L Jackson Trashes Trump On Jimmy Kimmel Live (VIDEO),"The racists came out in full force when Jimmy Kimmel put up a minute of video that is too outstanding to ignore. In a segment called,  The Hateful 8 Ball,  Kimmel gets advice from a mystical Samuel L Jackson inside a magic 8 ball toy. Jackson plays the part as you d expect, nailing the role of angry black man with iconic voice ever so perfectly.Definitely a great moment captured for all time   not only for a funny comedic piece, but as a historical record for the kind of racism that follows Donald Trump around. On hearing the name, the Trump trolls who keep this buffoon relevant enough that he might just win the GOP nomination hopped all over the comments on The Patriot Nation, the right-wing propaganda rag posting the video for other racists to be outraged at.This rocket doctor doesn t understand why racism has to be about race:When Bill Taylor, who went to Ball State University, says that President Obama had no qualifications other than he s black to run for president, that s it. All bets are off, Obama is worthless. Bill was obviously far too involved with the investigation into how little Obama was vetted to notice the birther movement, college transcript fiasco and fake Barry Soetoro stuff that still thrives in circles of stupidity all over the internet.Bill says he s a racist, pretty sure it s because he s black, not sure if we re talking about Jackson or Obama anymore; It s very sad.Then there are the people who just really are that stupid:It takes a classy person to be a Donald Trump supporter. You have to be able to just hate so indiscriminately. Can you actually consider yourself to be fair if you truly hate everyone equally? Hate just for hate s sake.You can enjoy the comments and maybe even make yourself a new conservative friend HERE.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 3, 2016"
 Cliven Bundy’s Sons Occupy Oregon Wildlife Reserve With Armed Militia Of ‘U.S. Patriots’ (VIDEO),"Last year, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made national headlines for his insane standoff with government officials over the illegal grazing of his cattle, and now his three sons have followed in his footsteps by taking up arms with  about 150  armed and dangerous militia members in an Oregon wildlife reserve. They are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in protest of the expected detainment of two ranchers in the area who are expected to face federal arson charges. Ammon Bundy, the presumed leader of this ridiculous occupation, made a video that was later uploaded to social media, where he said: We re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that s been set upon them. These people need to learn that they are not above the law. This  occupation  is illegal, and if they are taking up arms against the government they and all of their participants and supporters need to be hauled into federal custody and charged. That was the mistake before   Cliven Bundy and his right-wing militiamen never spent so much as a day behind bars for their insanity. Now, Ammon Bundy, his brothers, and other like-minded morons want to rule themselves free from government oversight in their own nutty enclave.Another presumed group leader, a man by the name of Blane Cooper, speaks in the video and trashes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the equivalent of  high school bullies : Until that line is drawn and say  we ve had enough of this tyranny, you are going to leave us alone  it will not change. Cooper goes on to encourage more occupations like this one across the country: It doesn t have to stop here. This could be a hope that spreads through the whole country, the whole United States. Everybody s looking for this hope because the government has beat us, and oppressed us, and took everything from us; they will not stop until we tell them no. Perhaps this time, the feds will take these lunatics seriously and arrest them.Watch the video of this insane anti-government speech below:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Here it is.

 Watch Heartbreaking Cries From An Abused Puppy As She Is Shown Love For The First Time (VIDEO),"A video of a terrified and previously abused puppy being shown love for the first time by her handler has captured the hearts and minds of many. The puppy, Priscilla, is crying out as a caretaker pets her. Not knowing how to react to the love she s shown for the first time, Priscilla cries out in anguish and fear but as the video progresses, amazing things happen.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogpZHkfN2I]Defenseless and petrified, Priscilla keeps snapping her head back to the hand of the caretaker, anxiously anticipating what the caretaker will do next. Watching Pricilla s trauma gives the viewer an idea of the magnitude of abuse Priscilla previously suffered.However, after a few strokes around her head, eyes, and ears, Priscella slowly yet surely calms. Later on in the video, Priscella is in the arms of her caretaker and she seems both comfortable and reassured that the people around her mean no harm.The last part of the video shows a happy Priscilla playing with her handler and another dog. She is bright, happy, and physically healthy, unlike the Priscilla we saw in the previous video. Not much is known about Priscilla other than the clear abuse she clearly incurred from her previous owner and that she is from Romania.It is striking what a little love and affection can do. If we treated all creatures in this manner, including each other, one can only imagine how wonderful the world we live in would be.Featured Image via YouTube Screen Capture from Daily Mail ",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Obama’s Photographer Releases White House’s Most Captivating Moments Of 2015 (IMAGES),"Having stayed close to the Obama family for both of President Barack Obama s terms, White House photographer Pete Souza has shared a variety of moments with our president and his family. Souza has gotten to witness both light-hearted and challenging moments for America s first African American president, and has had the privilege of capturing many of them on camera.As January marks the beginning of a new year, it also represents the last year that Barack Obama will lead the country. On Wednesday, Souza released his annual  Year in Photographs  list, revealing over 100 of the most memorable public and intimate moments of the Obama s life inside and outside of the White House. Souza explained: Editing photographs, especially for a project like this, is both subjective and personal. I not only found key historic moments from the year, but also chose moments that give people a more personal look at the lives of the President and First Lady. I ve also included many photographs that rely more on their graphic qualities, including light and composition. In Souza s collection, monumental wins such as the White House being lit with rainbow colors after the nationwide legalization of gay marriage are portrayed alongside heartbreaking losses such as the funeral of Vice President Joe Biden s son, Beau. There are also everyday family moments of the president interacting with staffer s children and his own family.

 Bernie Sanders Shows How To Properly Handle Hecklers As Trump Goon Interrupts His Rally (VIDEO),"A Donald Trump supporter came up with the worst idea ever when he got it into his head that it would be a good idea to try to heckle Bernie Sanders at a Massachusetts campaign rally. Clearly he did not know what he was getting himself into.The heckler was wearing a Trump shirt, and holding a sign that said  Obama is as Christian as Bruce Jenner is a woman.  As he started being an obnoxious twit, interrupting Bernie s speech and making a spectacle of himself, Bernie pointed right at him and said into the mic: Here s a Trump supporter worried about Mr. Trump s money. The crowd  took over at that point and started chanting Bernie s name over and over   completely denying the Trump goon s ability to speak.Waving his arms around and cheering for himself, the heckler was eventually escorted from the gathering by security while looking quite satisfied that he was immortalized on YouTube.After the interruption was over and without missing a beat, Bernie declared: I say to Mr. Trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation. Watch Bernie and his supports completely shut down the heckler below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJD0yUgb4J4&w=560&h=315]Protesting during political speeches is nothing new. Ever since Obama became president it has gone mainstream as a way to get candidates to immediately address issues. However, let s contrast Bernie and his supporters  reaction to your average Donald Trump rally.Bernie s people got a bit loud and drowned out the heckler while Bernie mostly stayed on topic without getting ugly towards him. When these same things happened at Trump rallies, the interrupters literally risked their lives. On one occasion, Trump encouraged his supporters to attack a black man, and on another yet another black man got ganged up on with Trump supporters saying Shoot him!   Kick his ass,  and  Light the motherf -r on fire! Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 2, 2016"
 What Twitter Just Did To Right-Wingers Makes Them Look Even More Like Terrorists (VIDEO),"Right-wing pundits on Fox and Friends this week went on a little tirade about the rules of Twitter and how unfair they are to conservatives. Host Clayton Morris joined National Review writer Katherine Timf in shredding Twitter s  Abusive Behavior Policy,  designed to keep people from bullying others on the internet. The problem the conservatives have with the rule isn t that you could be suspended or banned from Twitter for a few malicious reports   it s that there isn t enough distinction between them and ISIS terrorists.Yes, really. Conservatives are concerned that because the policy doesn t specifically mention ISIS that a bunch of other extremist loudmouths with violent agendas and histories may be targeted and removed from Twitter. They don t argue the point at all from the perspective that there s no reason to compare right-wing American  patriots  to terrorists because to suggest such a thing would be as ludicrous as any claim ever made about anything. Ever.Right-wingers are brash, crass, low-information degenerates. Occasionally you come across a right-winger with an intelligence level worthy of a game of Connect Four, but nothing you d consider the upper middle class to wealthy American they vote to please. They are led by their puppet masters on missions to free the world from the tyrannical rule of Barack Obama, the evils of Islam and atheism, and plain red Christmas cups. They have no argument because the facts the party that rules them feeds them are fabrications and fear tactics.If right-wingers don t like the fact that they have an extremist problem and that their own kind become radicalized and commit unimaginable acts of terror, they should do something about their own message. You can t have people running around vowing to die for their country when their country needs them to just stay home and count their rounds of ammo.Nobody wants that kind of person near them, which extends to our online persona. When a right-winger takes to social media and promises some  libtard  180 grains of Chris Kyle-like justice, they ve just broken the rules and committed a crime, all at the same time.They shouldn t be kicked off of Twitter why? Enough of those people together in groups become what terrorist organizations call  cells.  Here in America, we call them  militias.  Twitter is said to have deleted 44,000 accounts associated with ISIS. Right-wingers should be happy they aren t just denied access on general principle.Watch Fox and cronies bash Twitter for having rules about being decent human beings below:Featured image via liberalplanet.com",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Donald Trump Once Took Away A Sick Baby’s Medical Because Of A Family Feud,"It s undeniable that Donald Trump is a giant asshat. His entire campaign built upon the exploitation of American conservatives  racism, and faux populist rhetoric that is completely at odds with his economic policies that he has put forward. But Trump s asshattery isn t just reserved for people he can exploit for political gain.The New York Times recently ran an article that detailed the relationship between Trump and his brother Freddy. Trump s younger brother was an alcoholic who died at the age of 43. Freddy s alcoholism caused a major rift to form in the two brothers  relationship. One of the most scandalous revelations in the piece is that Trump once revoked medical benefits to his nephew s sick infant son. Trump had promised that he would pay for Fred III (Trump s nephew) child s medical care. But a feud over an inheritance dispute devolved, that changed all of that.The New York Times reports: Then came the unveiling of Fred Sr. s will, which Donald had helped draft. It divided the bulk of the inheritance, at least $20 million, among his children and their descendants,  other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr. Freddy s children sued, claiming that an earlier version of the will had entitled them to their father s share of the estate, but that Donald and his siblings had used  undue influence  over their grandfather, who had dementia, to cut them out.A week later, Mr. Trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew s infant child. Trump s family did not want to talk to the media about the matter. Trump offered the New York Times an explanation for his actions during an interview, saying,  I was angry because they sued.  Trump claims the whole thing was eventually settled  very amicably. Trump s villainy has officially reached daytime soap opera levels. For sure, much of Trump s hateful antics are a campaign tactic that he is using to get free media coverage. However, when a story like this come out, it shows that Trump actually is a terrible, vindictive person.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Christian Family Kills 41-Year-Old Mom During Attempted Exorcism,"On December 9, an unidentified 41-year-old mother was killed in a hotel room during an attempt by five family members to exorcise a demon which they claim was possessing her.According to authorities, the woman s family exerted massive force on her chest and stomach area,  as well an extreme amount of  violence to her neck.  A towel and a clothes hanger were shoved down her throat, reportedly to keep her from screaming.Prosecutors say that the woman was subjected to at least two hours of  pain and agony,  before she finally died from a combination of asphyxiation and traumatic injuries, all of which were sustained during the  exorcism. The killers include a 44-year-old female relative, along with the relative s children, a 21-year-old son, 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son. The 15-year-old son of the woman who was killed is also suspected of participating in the violence.Instead of calling police or paramedics after the woman died, the family called a priest.The priest immediately notified authorities, who ultimately discovered the woman s body at the Frankfurt InterContinental hotel.A second victim was later found, another 41-year-old woman, who is believed to be another family member. She was discovered inside a garage.According to Fox 10 in Phoenix, the second victim was taken to a hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia, dehydration and undisclosed injuries.The family involved in the woman s murder is South Korean, and had recently relocated to the Frankfurt, Germany area.The practice of exorcising demons, known as anchal-gido, is common among Charismatic Christians living Korea.As reported here and here, the western media often refers to these exorcisms as  Shamanism  when in fact they are legitimized by the Protestant Church in Korea.As Kyung Hong explains in the International Journal of Religion and Spirituality: anchal gido rituals are their own kind of abuse, since they often involve forms of physical violence against those deemed to be possessed.  The intensity of the healing prayers for cleansing demonic spirits also often accompanies intense physical contact in the belief that physical assaults intimidate and assist to expel demons. Thus, the healing ritual may well become so intense as to involve physical striking, beating, poling, or choking the possessed individual, though each action is viewed by the healers as attacking the demon, not the person. There is a similarity between Korean exorcism and shamanic rituals, but the latter often lacks the violence and is more about appeasing unfriendly nature or ancestral spirits than outright spiritual warfare. Religion Watch reports that in Korea, protestant women  who are seen as demon possessed are often viewed as disobedient to their husbands and are subject to shame and condemnation, even in their deaths. The facts about anchal-gido don t fit in with the western narrative of the Christian religion.When 18-year-old Rayoung Kim was killed in her home during a similar exorcism in Fairfax County, Virginia, the media reported that her death was due to a  Shamanistic exorcism,  although the facts in the case show that she died during the type of violent exorcism that is associated with anchal-gido, not kut or mudang, as the media routinely reported.The Shamanistic ritual of Kut involves singing, dancing and offering sacrifices. It is not associated with the violent  driving out of demons,  seen in these cases.That is far more typical of Korean Charismatic Christianity.In the case of the women killed in Frankfurt, the most telling sign that the family was conducting the kind of violent, Christian exorcism associated with anchal-gido is that the first person they called was a priest.Here in the U.S. we are constantly subjected to right-wing propaganda about the violent nature of the Muslim religion. At the same time, the media often presents us with a filtered version of current events, especially as they pertain to the Christian religion.Whether this is done purposely or out of ignorance and unconscious bias is up for debate.Either way, had this family killed a relative during a religious ceremony associated with Islam, the right wing would be all over that. In this case, however, the narrative will no doubt seek to shift the blame away from the Christian church and onto  Shamanism,  without a shred of evidence or single fact to support that theory.*Featured image credit: Michal via Flckr, CC 2.0",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Philadelphia New Year’s Parade Ruined By Racist White People In Brownface (IMAGES),"It s hard to believe that racism is still a key issue in a city with one of the highest African American populations in America, but that wasn t the case in Philadelphia on New Year s Day, when white people dressed up in brownface for the city s annual Mummers Parade and insulted #BlackLivesMatter protesters with racial slurs   while trying to argue that the parade wasn t racist!The Mummers Parade has been a New Year s Day tradition in Philadelphia where Mummers (amateur actors/Philadelphia citizens) dress up in extravagant costumes and perform throughout the city. As part of the costumes, it used to be common practice for the actors to wear blackface but this was curbed in 1964 after the NAACP and supporting protesters pressured the city to have it removed from the parade. Blackface was never officially sanctioned, so it still occurs despite the fact that blackface is now commonly regarded as racist. In response, the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice decided to schedule a rally during this year s Mummers Parade in protest.Coverage of the rally ended up exposing not only rampant racism, but misogyny. Along with the brownface, there were many men dressed up as  wenches  and some people even mocked the #BlackLivesMatter movement by carrying signs that said Wench Lives Matter,   Pirate Lives Matter  and  Shark Lives Matter  (which bared some resemblance to KKK attire).When parade participants heard of the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice rally, they began flooding the group s Mummers Parade Justice Rally s Facebook event page to convince America that the Mummers Day parade wasn t racist   and ironically showed an impressive amount of white privilege and N-bombs.It should be mentioned that #BlackLivesMatter wasn t even the sole purpose of the rally   it was just one of many issues that protesters had with the Mummers Parade. And the rally s intention was not to shut the Mummers Parade down. The Justice Rally s page wrote: Bring your signs, banners and noise makers to the Mummers parade and let s represent for the issues that matter to our communities! Our goal is to pack the stands and the parade route around city hall with people representing for #BlackLivesMatter in a city 48% black, funding public schools, fighting for a $15 minimum wage, dumping Trump, immigration rights and explosive oil trains. Not one mention of shutting the parade down, just the innocent intention of improving the lives of Philadelphians. Here are some of the horrendously racist, vile things people posted on the Justice Rally s event page in response: So improving Philadelphia is something to condemn, and yet behavior like what happened in the below Facebook post is perfectly acceptable at the Mummers Parade:If that had been a group of drunk black people p*ssing on homeless people, this would have never been accepted. Fortunately, there were also many people who recognized that the Mummers Parade does have a racist past and that racism and misogyny don t belong in such a widely celebrated parade.    Hopefully 2016 will be the year that the more offensive traits of the parade get squashed.Featured image via Joshua Scott Albert Twitter",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Check Out The New Dating Website That Caters Specifically To White Pride (IMAGES),"Let s just say that if you consider being white the best thing about yourself, you must live one sad, lonely, and pathetic life. One of these pathetic people apparently felt the need to create a  whites only  website to meet like-minded folk. And not just any website, a dating website.What is this dating website called?  Where White People Meet,  of course. Duh.Of course, they re not gonna just come out and say they re racist. They re just going to make the website, in the predominantly white state of Utah, and claim that it s just like any other dating website. Here s what it says in their  About Us!  section: We developed this dating website as an alternative to the other dating websites that cater to certain groups. We simply want to help people connect in a safe and fun online environment without costing them a ton of money. Enjoy! Except, who is it an alternative for? It looks as though, for just $4, it s an exclusive alternative for anti-gay white supremacists. It seems as though one can t search for a same-sex pairing, and the website doesn t state where it stands on polygamy.via WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com What s even more bizarre is the fact that they would advertise this  whites only  on billboards in Utah, a state that is 91.4 percent white. Is it really that hard to find other white singles in Utah? Chances are, if you run into a single person, they re going to be white. So, why bother, unless you just want to be a racist douchebag?West Valley billboard promotes Utah-based dating site geared toward white people: https://t.co/aiEKVRuMD8 pic.twitter.com/5PY1rs58pc  Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) December 31, 2015Of course, the website states that it has nothing to do with racism: I am sure some of you are wondering about the concept and need for a dating website titled  Where White People Meet.Com.  Our answer to that would be why not? There are various dating websites that promote and cater to just about every origin, race, religion and lifestyle out there. So again, why not  Where White People Meet.Com ? Basically, it s a  don t forget white people exist, too  website. Which is often code among white supremacists who feel they are being overrun by people born with more melanin in their skin. They have to make sure they are seen and heard. So, while they try to say things like: As you navigate the website and begin to interact with other members, please remember the golden rule of  treat others as you want to be treated.  The staff here at Where White People Meet will not tolerate rude, aggressive or racist behavior. The last thing we want it to have to remove a member of this community but please know that we will. They should be aware that creating a website in a nearly entirely white state to cater to only white people is pretty damn racist in and of itself. And while the NAACP has determined that it doesn t seem to be the work of a hate group, the whole thing just seems really weird and unnecessary. In fact, if this whole thing turned out to some satirical joke, it wouldn t at all be surprising. It s that weird.Featured image: WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com",News,"January 2, 2016"
 The Funniest And Most Obscene Local News FAILS Of 2015 (VIDEO),"You can always count on local newscasters to make complete asses of themselves, with invariably hilarious results.

Of course, they couldn t help but to include some cable news bloopers in the mix.Along those lines is the unbelievably stupid clip of a Fox News Channel reporter hurling an ax at a target, then wildly missing the target and instead hitting a military marching band member performing on the other side of the target. Worse, the reporter reacted by pulling one of these:  \_( )_/ The Fox News ax incident should really be blamed on the producers who decided it d be a great idea to place human beings on the other side of a giant target, then to have a doofus reporter attempt to toss at ax at the target.

 Totally Blow The Minds Of Tea Partiers With The REAL HISTORY Of The Tea Party Movement,"It s been just about seven years since the official founding of the tea party movement. Weird, it seems like much, much longer, but there it is. Seven years since tri-corner hats festooned with tea bags became the national symbol of incoherent, far-right outrage over the ascendancy of an African-American president tasked with lifting the nation out of a devastating Great Recession not of his own making.The tea party emerged as an unofficial sequel to the angry mobs that formed outside various McCain/Palin rallies during the 2008 campaign, complete with viral video messages warning of emerging communism,  Hussein  sleeper-cells and Rev. Jeremiah Wright goddamn-America-hating. A general profile of each group showed considerable overlap: white, Christian, conservative, older Americans who were both shell-shocked by the financial impact of the recession and that the obvious cultural shift taking place in politics, potentially leaving them behind. The president was no longer a twangy, southern good ol  boy or a congenial, plain-spoken old man. This new president would be a northern intellectual   an African-American man with an  exotic  name and an allegedly suspicious background. A flaming cocktail for inciting white conservative fear.Fast forward to the months following the January, 2009 inauguration.Coinciding with congressional debate over the new president s stimulus package, the movement proudly adopted as its namesake the Boston Tea Party, with  tea  carrying the bonus  taxed enough already  acronym. Both meanings contained within the name of the movement were hilariously ironical given how the stimulus would eventually contain, as a total dollar amount, the largest middle class tax cut in American history as well as the fact that the Boston Tea Party was a protest against a corporate tax cut.Feel free to spring this one on your conservative friends. You ll render them speechless.Rewind to 1773 and the passage of the Tea Act, the British law which ultimately sparked the infamous Boston Tea Party.The East India Company, an 18th Century corporation   the McDonald s or Amazon of its era   was in serious financial trouble, and being so closely tied to the economy of Great Britain, it was too big to fail.But rather than bailing out the corporation, King George and Lord North decided that if they just cut the export duty of the company to zero, allowing it to sell directly to the colonies, the East India Company would easily be able to unload its tea to colonial consumers at a discount   boosting sales and rescuing the near-bankrupt mega-corporation. Plus, they reasoned, the colonists would embrace the British monarchy for the cheaper tea, and tensions between the empire and the colonies would be ameliorated, at least temporarily.So in May, 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act. The long-form subtitle of the act read as follows: An act to allow a drawback of the duties of customs on the exportation of tea to any of his Majesty s colonies or plantations in America; to increase the deposit on bohea tea to be sold at the East India Company s sales; and to empower the commissioners of the treasury to grant licenses to the East India Company to export tea duty-free. Several months later, the East India Company attained the proper clearances and set off to various colonial sea ports with its duty-free tea.To repeat, the rationale for the Tea Act was that lower taxes meant lower prices, which meant the East India Company could sell a hell of a lot more tea. Suffice to say, the smaller colonial tea distributors weren t happy   not to mention smugglers like Samuel Adams  close confidant John Hancock. Colonial retail prices would be severely undercut by the tax-free tea, potentially shoving the smaller importers, and smugglers like Hancock, out of the tea business.It was your basic free market precursor to supply-side Reaganomics in action. In other words, the British government s solution to the East India Company s financial crisis was, in effect, a massive tax cut   a tax cut to zero.Consequently, political activists and, most famously, the Sons of Liberty, proceeded to intimidate and raid   with orders to tar and feather the pilots   any East India tea ship landing at various ports from Philadelphia to Sandy Hook to, naturally, Boston. And later that year, on December 16, 1773, when East India vessels, the Dartmouth, Beaver and Eleanor, were docked in Boston Harbor, the Sons carried out their famous protest, dumping hundreds of crates of tea into the water.All because of a tax cut. Not only that, but the tea party Republicans, while comporting themselves as cheap knock-offs of the Sons of Liberty, have instead embraced the tax-cutting, supply-side policies of the British monarchy.Whoops.Boiled down, it appears as though the tea party movement is in favor of tax cuts, while embracing a historical event that was violently opposed to a massive tax cut. In the interim, the tea party has vocally objected to the notion that something like 47 percent of Americans don t pay federal income taxes. Who is the 47 percent? Forbes broke it down: 17 percent includes students, people with disabilities or illnesses, the long-term unemployed, and other people with very low taxable incomes. Also included would be people like our soldiers in foreign wars who are exempted from paying income taxes while they are on active duty in a war zone. 22 percent of people who did not pay federal income taxes in 2009 are people aged 65 or older who have modest incomes (and do not have earnings). 61 percent are working people who pay payroll taxes but are not paying income taxes.It s important to highlight that these 47 percenters do, in fact, pay state, local, sales and other taxes. So the tea party appears to be in favor of higher taxes for families, seniors and disabled Americans, while also being in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations, the latter being the exact opposite of the Sons of Liberty. You d think the tea party, which has apparently been  taxed enough already,  would support the idea that nearly half of us don t pay federal income taxes. But they don t. Weirdly.Obviously the tea party s organizers failed to read about history before inappropriately horking the  tea party  moniker, and, indeed, they re more than a little confused about taxes, both modern and historical   the issue upon which the entire movement is based.Whoops again.Anyway, happy seventh anniversary, you magnificent bastards. Hopefully in honor of this occasion, someone will give you the gift that keeps on giving: some high school level history and economics books.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Texas ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Shoots 6-Year-Old In Spine After Family Makes Wrong Turn (VIDEO),"When Texas governor Greg Abbott said that Texans should  be tolerant  of anyone they see with a handgun in light of the state s recent decision to allow concealed carry permit holders to openly display their sidearms, one thing he didn t think about is that every single person carrying a gun isn t necessarily licensed to do so   but he effectively told residents to accept that every single handgun they see is legal because reasons.Unfortunately, this simply empowers the criminal element   after all, according to the NRA, everyone with a gun is a  good guy  who will save the world. That is, until the  good guy  rips off his mask and reveals that he was a  bad guy  all along.On Tuesday, a  bad guy with a gun  (who looks exactly like a  good guy  until he actually begins shooting) fired numerous rounds at a vehicle containing a family that had done nothing worse than make a wrong turn, severely injuring a child. The family was in the area looking for a tire shop when they became lost and pulled into the parking lot of some townhouses to reroute their GPS.According to investigators, the car s lights were shining on another car. The occupant became annoyed, walked toward the family s vehicle and fired nine shots, one of them piercing through the vehicle s taillight and striking a 6-year-old girl, the bullet lodging itself into her spine. Panicked, the driver attempted to escape as the shooter fired four more rounds at the vehicle as it exited the property. The family drove down the street to a motel and flagged down an officer. The little girl was rushed to the hospital for treatment.A SWAT team detained a person of interest who was arrested on unrelated charges, but he has still not been charged in the child s shooting according to police.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via Examiner",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Laughing Cops Took Turns Shooting Puppy (VIDEO),"On December 10, Chester Pennsylvania police officers shot and killed one-year-old Bear, a mixed breed family dog, who had been rescued by his owners just months before.According to Christie Fry, the owner of the dog, she first encountered Bear when he was just four months old. Three months later, she brought the injured pup home to join her family. Bear came into my life in May as a rescue. He was seven months old and had a broken leg. He was brought into my family and his leg healed better than expected without requiring surgery. He could run and jump like a normal dog. I loved this dog. I fell in love when I first met him as a four month old pup. But two weeks before Christmas, Chester police pumped eight bullets into Bear, as the horrified mother watched from her window.Fry says that she heard Bear barking in the backyard at about 10:00 am that morning. There was construction going on at the house next door. She explains that Bear was securely hooked up on a tie out in the yard, so she didn t see his barking as a cause for concern.About ten minutes later she heard the first gun shots.I hear two gunshots. As I m getting up I hear the third. As soon as I m standing, I can see out my side window. Police. Fourth shot. I look at what they re doing and see my dog on the ground. My dog starts screaming. I scream. More shots. Five, six, seven, eight. There s two cops taking turns shooting him with smiles on their faces.Fry says she ran out the door, yelling  What the hell? One of the officers asked  Is this your dog? She says that after she told them  yes  and tried to asked what happened.The response she was given is even more disturbing.The officer said (and I quote)  Well you don t have a dog anymore. He s done now!  and laughed in my face.She goes on to say,My one-year-old puppy that I did everything in my power to save was laying there dead. They shot my dog like he was a human coming at them with a gun.Bear was killed less than two feet from his own dog house, located near the fence that separates Christie Fry s property from the house next door.image credit: puppycidedb.comA photo of his body shows that the fence between the Fry s yard and the neighbor s was open. Bear s body is lying just on the other side of the fence.In a subsequent report filed by the police, officers claimed that they had received  complaints  about Bear.Christie Fry says she was never informed of any complaints from anyone.She was at home at the time that police, accompanied by an animal control officer, came to her home. No one ever knocked on her door or made an effort to contact her.Instead it appears that the cops and the animal control officer went directly to the Fry s backyard, where Bear was barking and restrained.According to animal control, Bear conveniently  broke loose from his tie-out  at that time. He claims that Bear knocked him over. He denies that the dog ever bit him or even tried to bite him.Even if the puppy did knock him down, which is doubtful, why was it necessary for cops to shoot him eight times?Christie Fry has started a Go Fund Me page to raise the money to hire a lawyer. As she points out here, the area around Bear s dog house is bare dirt, as is the neighboring yard. Yet she says that there was not a speck of dust or dirt on the animal control officer s suit, even though he claimed that he was knocked into the dirt by an overly zealous puppy.It seems more likely that the cops went to the Fry s home that day with every intention of killing the dog. They likely thought there was no-one at home to witness the shooting. That would explain why neither animal control nor the police made any attempt to talk to his owner, but headed straight for the backyard instead.Fry acknowledges on her Go Fund Me page that  Bear was a barker.  Was he just getting on the nerves of the construction crew next door?If there were complaints about Bear, police have yet to provide his owner with any details of those complaints.This is not the first time that Chester police have come under fire for killing a dog.In 2013, shocked bystanders captured video of officers opening fire on a pickup truck that was occupied by dogs. The truck was parked directly in front of the high school. Police opened fire, shooting toward both the truck and the school during the student lunch period.Here s more on that story from NBC News: According to Chester mayor John Linder, police followed  all protocol  when they opened fire on the pickup truck, ultimately killing three dogs.Since the dogs involved in that incident were pit bulls, the mayor justified the actions of police by citing a supposed  violent history of the animals in question.  (Here s what happened when our guest writer let a pit bull near his baby.)In a statement published by the Daily Times, Mayor Linder said: (P)olice personnel immediately arrived on scene and assessed the severity of the situation. They took immediate action to ensure that no one in the vicinity could be harmed. Meaning they did exactly what witnesses said they did. They pulled up in their vehicles, grabbed their guns and started shooting  immediately,  into the bed of a pickup truck, in front of a school, while school was in session.According to the mayor, two dogs were killed inside the truck. A third was killed  after it exited the truck.  That means they were shooting at a moving target in front of the school, with people standing all around.The shooting was justified because, according to the mayor, the three dogs were a greater threat to the public than a hailstorm of bullets.The mayor stated that the officers involved in the shooting outside the school were in communication with the city s only animal control officer.It s likely this is the same animal control officer that was on the scene when Bear was killed.In a Twitter post, Fry points out that it s not only police that she wants to see held accountable.Image credit: Chris Christie on Twitter, via PuppycideBDIn his 2013 statement, Mayor Linder also said, We don t want to be known as a place that abuses animals or kills dogs. How about not allowing laughing cops to get away with killing innocent family pets, like Bear, who had never even been accused of biting anyone?Fry is in search of an attorney who will help bring the officers that killed Bear to justice.You can donate to Fry s legal fund here.*Featured image credit: Bear, via Chris Christie on Facebook",News,"January 2, 2016"
 E-mails Show Coordination Between Mayor’s Office And Chicago PD Over Laquan McDonald Shooting,"New e-mails obtained by media outlets show that there was coordination between the Chicago Police Department, the Independent Police Review Board, and the Mayor Rahm Emanuel s office over video footage that shows Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shoot Laquan McDonald 16 times.Chicago activists and others have hammered the Rahm administration over the delayed release of the video. McDonald was shot to death in October, 2014. Yet, the video of the shooting was not released until November 24, 2015. McDonald was killed by the Chicago Police Department during Chicago s mayoral election. Releasing the video would have been put the Emanuel under national scrutiny. This has led many to believe that the Mayor s office and the CPD were working in a collaborative effort to delay the release of the video to avoid being hurt politically.In one e-mail, attorney Jeffrey J. Neslund explained to city lawyers that the video is going to be very bad for the city. I submit the graphic dash cam video will have a powerful impact on any jury and the Chicago community as a whole. This case will undoubtedly bring a microscope of national attention to the shooting itself as well as the city s pattern, practice and procedures in rubber-stamping fatal police shootings of African Americans as  justified.' Critics of Emanuel and major media publications have called for Rahm Emanuel to resign.The Associated Press reports that the e-mails that were released shows that Emanuel s aids were well aware that releasing the video would be politically explosive. One e-mail in late July even showed that Emanuel s aids were concerned that people that people were beginning to view the case as a cover up. As you might imagine, the timing and details discussed in the Sun-Times article and growing interest in the McDonald incident has not worked in our favor, and is helping to  stir the pot,'  Emanuel aide Vance Henry wrote.In another e-mail, Henry wrote in October, saying that officials would be  smart to act timely and strategically  in reference to McDonald s death and another case where a Chicago police officer killed a 22-year-old woman named Rekia Boyd.These e-mails will not help the Mayor s office convince people that the delay of the video was not politically motivated.This alleged cover up is not the only  sin  that is  catching up to  Emanuel, as Rick Perlstein describes  The Sudden But Well-Deserved Fall of Rahm Emanuel  in The New Yorker. Emanuel s political career has been defined by his war against teachers, privatization schemes, and his efforts to make the Democratic Party unrecognizable from the Republican Party by fighting against  liberal theology,  as he describes it.Featured Image Credit: Daniel X.

 Suckers! Sarah Palin Bought This Mansion With The Money Conservatives Gave Her (PHOTOS),"It pays well to be a failed right-wing candidate. Sarah Palin, who served a half term as Alaska s governor and made a halfhearted attempt to become vice president next to John McCain, has profited quite nicely from her place in the conservative universe.After losing the 2008 election, Palin quickly quit being governor of Alaska and became a pundit on Fox News Channel. She signed a book deal and pumped out several tomes (her most recent book is Sweet Freedom: A Devotional), likely ghostwritten by writers who will be forever anonymous, and set up a political action committee, SarahPAC, that went to work buying thousands of her own books   helping to send them up the bestseller charts.While her deal with Fox was ended by the network (after they built her a custom studio at her Alaska home, she rarely appeared on the network outside of goofy appearances on Sean Hannity s program), she ran an online subscription TV service for a while before that abruptly ended, and now appears on the fringe One America News Network. That network has promoted itself as the conservative alternative to Fox News, but does not have mainstream satelitte or cable tv coverage.In 2011 Palin purchased a mansion in Arizona for $1.695 million, and is now selling the property for $2.499 million. She ll make a profit on the home, thanks in part to the Obama agenda she opposed improving the economy and the real estate market.While Palin styles herself as just a hockey mom who loves her country, the 8,000 square foot home is not exactly a humble home on the range.The nearly 8,000-square-foot home was built in 2001. Some of its features include high ceilings, chandeliers and wrought-iron railings.The home also boasts a media room/theater, a wine cellar, six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. One of the two master suites includes a rooftop deck.The outdoor area features a built-in grill station, a fire pit, a pool, a spa, a water-saving synthetic lawn and a lighted sports court complete the more than four-acre equestrian-zoned grounds. There s also a six-car garage.The home is inside a gated community, so not just anyone can come inside to pal around with the Palins.Here s how the realtor sells the property to prospective buyers:This pristine gated estate is sure to impress as you enter from a wraparound drive to access the private gated entrance. Masterfully designed & built this 7971 sqft home showcases 6 bedrooms, 6.5 baths, a 6 car garage & breathtaking mountain views from virtually every room! Quality & care echoes throughout, with beautiful finishes, fixtures, fireplaces, chandeliers, soaring ceilings, media theater, wine cellar & more. Craftsmanship extends to the resort themed backyard with fireplaces off the covered patio, veranda & rooftop deck off of the master suite. Luxury abounds with a built-in grill station, fire-pit, sparkling blue pool, spa, synthetic grass & a lighted sports court.

" Donald Trump Gets Schlonged By His Own Ghost Writer, Who Refuses To Vote For Him (AUDIO)","When Donald Trump  wrote  a book in 2000, he didn t think it would come back to bite him on the ass.But that book, and the man who actually wrote it, have surfaced to draw a picture of a Donald Trump who is doing the total opposite of what he said sixteen years ago.Dave Shiflett did the heavy lifting on Trump s book  The America We Deserve,  and during an appearance on Fox News Radio with Alan Colmes, the ghost writer slammed the Republican presidential wannabe for being a total asshole who has completely contradicted himself in an attempt to become the GOP nominee. I used to think it was my first work of fiction,  Shiflett said of the book before remarking that it s hard to know where Trump stands on anything because he s a thematic person.Shiflett went on to describe how Trump used to hold very progressive views such as supporting single-payer healthcare and tax increases on the wealthy. He also mentioned how Trump ironically used to criticize Pat Buchanan for saying  too many outrageous and controversial things  to be considered a serious candidate for the presidency. In short, Trump once believed that being outrageous and controversial automatically disqualifies someone from being commander-in-chief, which means he would be disqualified himself since he has clearly adopted Pat Buchanan s style.And despite being Trump s ghost writer, there is no way in hell that Shiflett is voting for him.In the beginning of his campaign, Trump attacked Senator John McCain for being a POW during the Vietnam War, a war that Trump avoided by dodging the draft. McCain was captured after being shot down by enemy forces and he was then brutally tortured to the point where he can no longer lift his arms over his head. Shiflett has been angry about Trump s treatment of McCain ever since, and for good reason. I ll tell you what really bugs me about him, where it really ripped it with me and Trump was the stuff he said about McCain. McCain suffered severely, and I had a son who did two tours in Middle East during the last war and we had kids from here who went over there and some of them got hurt. They ain t gonna be the same. Here s the audio via Buzzfeed:Sounds like Trump s criticism of McCain was the last straw for Shiflett, as it probably was for many Americans. The fact is that John McCain is a war hero who sacrificed for his country, something that Donald Trump refused to do when he had the same opportunity to fight during the war. Instead, Trump chose to dodge the draft through multiple deferments, including a questionable medical deferment.Also, the fact that Donald Trump is using the Pat Buchanan playbook in his run for president is scary, especially since it appears to actually be working this time around 24 years after Americans rejected it when Buchanan sought the Republican nomination in 1992. This just shows how racist and sexist the Republican Party has become over the last two and a half decades.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"January 2, 2016"
" Four Shot Dead, One Left To Face Charges As Family Of Drunken Gun Collector Fight Over Laundry","Alcohol and guns could be the worst idea ever conceived by humanity. Drinking too much induces poor judgement and anger. Guns produce death and destruction when subject to poor judgement and anger. That was certainly the case in Los Angeles, where a man described as a  heavy drinker  had himself a gun collection and an argument that led to a whole lot of death.The 54-year-old man was apparently arguing over the washing machine, according to the Daily Mail. That escalated into the man shooting and killing his bedridden wife, his son s girlfriend and a 27-year-old man who was visiting. His son then wrestled the gun from his father and shot him, bringing the senseless death toll over a washing machine to four.Neighbors said the son is a 28-year-old with an 8-month-old daughter. The police say they ve been called to the residence on many occasions.And therein lies the problem. Police sent to disturbances at a house like that are bound to know there are weapons on the premises. The man isn t obligated to show them to officers, produce registration or insurance, or prove that he is qualified to fire a weapon safely. If he s a habitual drinker, the end result was always going to be a lot of death. What can the police do? Nothing.Now the son is facing murder charges, which means after he got to witness his father murder his mother, his girlfriend and his friend in cold blood, he wrestled the gun away and executed his own father in what many would call a justifiable fit of rage and others would call another consequence of Americans having unlimited access to guns.The entire incident is nothing but a waste of human life and a tragic start to the mass shootings counter for 2016.Featured Image via downingcentrecourt.com.au",News,"January 2, 2016"
 Responsible Gun Owner Tries To Use Gun As Alarm Clock – Ends Up Shooting Friend Dead,"If someone were to ask regular people on the street how they would wake up a sleeping person, they would probably shake them or possibly yell,  Wake up!  Normal stuff, right? However, there is nothing normal about your average Second Amendment enthusiast.A man in Chandler, Arizona has been arrested after he allegedly lied to police about fatally shooting an  intruder  on New Year s Eve.It seems like it was your average night. Young people were having a get-together of some kind on New Year s Eve. We have all been to one of these and there is always that one person that falls asleep early. This seems to be exactly what happened in this case.Gage Bodenheimer was at his friend Nathaniel Thomas  apartment. While there, Gage fell asleep on the floor. Not a huge surprise so far, because it gets late and not everyone is a night owl. It was supposed to be a nice night with friends   but someone invited the Second Amendment and he ruined the party.While Gage was sleeping on the floor, his friend Nathaniel decided he should be awake. Instead of nudging him or speaking loudly, Nathaniel decided to point a gun at his friend and pull the trigger   in an effort to make repeated trigger clicks to awaken Gage.Moments later, Gage was dead as Nathaniel   thinking the gun was unloaded   ended up blowing his friend away with the obviously loaded gun.Nathaniel must have heard from the NRA that he was not responsible for his own firearm irresponsibility because he called 911 and reported that he shot an intruder in his home. There were a couple problems with that. One is that the cops could tell immediately that something was amiss due to the nature of the scene. Second, there were witnesses there in the apartment the whole time. All the police had to do, even if they were so inept at investigating the scene, was to ask any person present what happened.The whole affair was infinitely dumb on Nathaniel s part. Then again, your average person who uses a gun as an alarm clock is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier.Nathaniel was promptly arrested after witnesses informed the police of what happened.Featured image via Photobucket",News,"January 2, 2016"
 You Won’t Believe Who Paid For the Anti-Trump Sky Ads at the Rose Bowl,"It turns out that the individual who bought the anti-Trump sky ads at the Rose Bowl is a supporter of Trump s rival for the Republican nomination. That person happens to be Luther Stan Pate IV, a real estate developer worth millions, who is a backer of Marco Rubio.Pate had already donated $5,000 to the Rubio campaign in early 2015, before Rubio officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. FEC filings show that Pete is listed as the Treasurer and Custodian of Records for a new group called the  WeThePeople Foundation,  an anti-Trump PAC set up on December 29th.The banners read  Anybody but Trump,   Iowans Dump Trump , and  America is Great Trump is Disgusting  in the sky at the Rose Bowl with a number of skywriting planes. The skywriting also directed individuals to the PAC s new website where people can view even more attacks on the controversial billionaire candidate. The website  allows visitors to buy anti-Trump items, and to post anti-Trump videos and material.So what is Pate s motivation behind spending lots of time and money attacking Trump, another Republican candidate? Apparently, Pate is an establishment GOP figure and Trump has been smashing all of the establishment GOP candidates   including Bush, Kasich, and Christie. Meanwhile, Carson s campaign appears to be coming to a halt, with many in his campaign jumping ship. A Republican strategist said: People are finally taking the threat that Trump will destroy the Republican Party and lose the general election to Hillary Clinton seriously. Establishment Republicans believe that the controversial billionaire has alienated a large sector of the Republican voting block. His sexist statements on women, his racist statements on Mexicans, and his Islamophobic rants have led many to believe that he wouldn t stand a chance against the Democratic nominee. That apparently means that besides the creepy Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio is the only establishment-backed Republican who has any shot at beating Trump and winning the nomination.Hopefully all the Republican candidates and their supporters will continue to discredit each other.

 Carly Fiorina’s Poor Attempt To Pander To Iowa Football Fans Goes Horribly Wrong (TWEETS),"It s the beginning of the new year, and the Iowa caucus is about a month away. With it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible. A big win in Iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race, proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere, or just plain calling it quits. For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers. Get a load of this, though: She tweeted on Friday that she wanted the Iowa Hawkeyes to beat her alma mater Stanford during the Rose Bowl.Pic via Twitter.How stupid does she think Iowa voters are? In any case, not only did it NOT work, but it ended up backfiring on her   Twitter absolutely roasted her for it.  Even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what, this just further proves it.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Those tweets aren t even the half of it. All it took was eleven simple words, and all pandemonium broke out. A natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians, but the truth is Carly brought this on herself. You should NEVER root against your own alma mater to pander to votes, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. People would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns. People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much). All this proves is that Carly thinks Republicans in Iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this.

" Jeb! Makes Awkward ‘Hurricane Katrina’ Joke, Reminds Voters Of Brother’s Awful Record (VIDEO/TWEETS)","Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has once again reminded everyone of how awful his older brother was for America.Jeb, who has been struggling in the polls andis nowhere near being a potential 2016 nominee for the Republican party, tried to make a (completely awkward) joke about Hurricane Katrina during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Jeb had been trying to compliment South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy and thought it would be appropriate to do so by nicknaming her after the hurricane, which was responsible for the deaths of almost 2,000 people. Bush said, in front of the audience in Lexington: In fact, when I was governor, in 16 months we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. One of them was called Katrina. I don t know why your great state senator reminds me of a hurricane. But she does. She s strong and she s fierce, and she s solving problems for you at the state capitol. You should be honored to have her as your elected official. I hope you agree with that. That should be your nickname. In the Bush family, we always give out nicknames. Yours is now Hurricane Katrina. Here s a video of Jeb telling his joke:Shealy, who is a Republican, called the nickname endearing  and  sweet,  and said in an interview with CNN: Everybody in my family, when they had Hurricane Katrina, it was kind of like a big joke in my family because I m the feisty one in the family. I m the one that kinda bosses everybody around. When Jeb made that statement, he didn t consider that his nickname might actually be reminding people about how disastrous the government s response to the 2005 hurricane was under the control of former President George W. Bush, and that it s been regarded as one of the lowest points of his presidency. Because of Bush s pathetic handling of the hurricane, Hurricane Katrina became the most costly national disaster in America s history. The former president s response was widely criticized, as people blasted him for sitting on his hands as the natural disaster devastated southern states.Of course, Jeb received loads of backlash for his comment, as people jumped to give him a dose of reality:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFollowing Jeb s comments, The Daily Beast asked Jeb s communications team for comment on the weird joke, and was instead given a transcript of what Jeb said. Later, The Daily Beast got a message from Jeb himself, stating that  It was a joke.  When the news source asked Jeb if he felt his  joke  was insensitive, he said  No. TwitterTwitterJeb has made quite the habit of positively framing his older brother s most disgraceful presidential performances. In the past, Jeb was under fire for defending Bush s terrorism record, seemingly having forgotten all about 9/11.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 1, 2016"
 R.I.P. GOP White House Dreams? U.S. Jobs Haven’t Grown This Much Since The ‘90s,"It has been sixteen years since the American economy has added as many jobs as it added in 2015. Economic observers believe, pending the upcoming jobs report that will indicate how many jobs were added in December of 2015, that last year 2.5 million jobs were added to the U.S. economy. That is a feat that hasn t been accomplished since 1998-99, during the Clinton boom.Under President Obama, the economy has completely flipped from its death spiral under the Bush recession.Even with weakness seen during the summer, job gains in 2015 will top 2.5 million, making it the second-best calendar year for U.S. job growth in this millennium, after last year s 3.1 million. The last time more jobs were created in a two-year period was at the height of the dot-com boom, in 1998-1999.The December totals should get a shot in the arm from the warm weather, said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. He forecasts an overall gain of 215,000.Barclays told Marketwatch they believe the current unemployment rate of 5.0% will fall to 4.3% by the end of 2016 and 3.7% by the end of 2017.Unemployment reached a high of 10% in the months after President Obama took over from George W. Bush.The growing economy is one of the strongest factors in favor of Democrats retaining the White House, even though it is generally difficult for one party to hold the office for three consecutive terms, a feat last accomplished in 1988 with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush.It may explain why many of the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, are increasing how often they speak about the threat of international terrorism. Those candidates have decided to down play the work of the American military in combating terrorism, even as top ISIS leaders die via American bombing raids.Yet even that may be a failing strategy. After the tragic terror attacks on Paris, polls showed that the candidate most trusted to deal with terrorism is Secretary Hillary Clinton, who is also the candidate most closely affiliated with President Obama.On two of the most pressing issues, Republicans have the most recent national failures on their ledger. The economic collapse under Bush, and the growth of international terrorism, particularly the worst terrorist attack in American history, under Bush.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Guess Who Donald Trump Blames For His Ridiculous Orange Clown Hair (VIDEO),"During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s.

There is something you can have more valuable than money.  This is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the Bible, and become a Christian.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via TwitterBesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a $20-dollar bill, the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting Christian might hand out on the street. The person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that Wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds Jesus. Things and people will disappoint you. Nothing in this world will really satisfy. That is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by God, who created you,  the note reads.Photo Courtesy: Garret Wyman via Twitter I m 17-years-old, $7,000 in debt because I had to buy myself a car, juggling full-time school, and working seven days a week,  Wayman told Tech Insider, adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a $20 tip at the restaurant I work at is very, very rare. Restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips. So it is understandable why Wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him. He just left that,  Wayman said.  I wanted to tell him that I only make $3 an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than I deserve, but he was gone by the time I had the chance to. The internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general. People in the service industry work hard for almost no pay, and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive. I m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed.

 Ted Cruz Tells His Fanatics To Put On Their ‘Armor Of God’ To Prepare To Fight For Him,"In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their  armor of God  and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming,  Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth,  Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia",News,"January 1, 2016"

Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is. The NRA constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t. Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Heartbreaking: This Democratic Senator Just Tweeted The Entire Mass Shooting History Of 2015,"A Democratic Senator decided to close out 2015 by raising a strong awareness of just how bad America s gun violence problem is. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) made a list of every mass shooting, including the number injured or killed, and posted it to his Twitter account. The list can be paged through, with each entry showing the number of injured and dead.Take a few moments and page through the list below. The tragedy that was 2015 becomes quickly apparent.#ICYMI   for my year in review I listed out every single mass shooting in 2015. They're all here: https://t.co/bUSKcjHs2x  Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2015While paging through the list, the reality of our problem with guns becomes undeniable to even the most backwards, gun-toting, Tea Party patriot. Contrasted with a nation like Japan, which averages less than 1 gun death per 100,000 people most years (sometimes averaging so low the statistic is virtually zero), you can see that we simply do not have to live with this as a reality of our society.Many of the incidents that were included never made it to the mainstream media, because they were just not sensational enough. Let s think about that for a minute. In Japan, there was a year when 22 shootings occurred. It became a national scandal. In America, if we had a year with 22 gun deaths, the only  newsworthy  portion of it would be how America  solved  its problem with gun violence.Senator Murphy added the following comment to his post:In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings   incidents where four or more people where shot, including the shooter. I went through each and every one of them on shootingtracker.com, and tweeted out the stories. In the face of this carnage, there is no excuse for our inaction.Senator Murphy s context is very important. Only incidents where four or more people were shot made his list. There are far more that did not. The total number of shootings for 2015 so far stands at an astounding 52,339, with 13,296 deaths. To add a bit of context to the total, only 1,935 were able to be deemed  accidental,  which includes most acts of irresponsible use or storage of firearms.Very slowly, things are beginning to change. President Obama has plans, by way of executive order, to increase the requirements for background checks as well as strengthen the requirements for reporting lost or stolen guns. Coupled with California s new initiative allowing state government to seize guns from those deemed a menace to society, 2016 could mark a slight turning point in NRA dominance over gun safety in America.Featured image via senate.gov",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO),"On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video,"After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for ""total Muslim ban"" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Skywriter Leaves HILARIOUSLY Honest Messages About Trump Above Rose Parade (IMAGES),"There are a lot of ways to express your disfavor of a presidential candidate. However, some are just far more entertaining and hilarious than others.Some people choose to show up to campaign events and protest. Others may bombard a candidate on Twitter. And then there s the group that goes all out, hires a skywriter, and has a message of disdain written across the sky over the nationally televised Rose Parade.It looks as thought the people over at AnybodybutTrump.us have done just that.Who was this contempt aimed at? None other than Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump who has the now infamous campaign slogan of  Make America Great Again! What did the skywriter write across the sky for all to see?

It seems when Trump says that Americans  love  him, it may not be as many as he d like to think.Truth is, America is pretty damn great already, and has gotten better under President Obama. These Republican candidates who claim they want to turn things around or make things great again apparently liked an America on the brink of another depression. They apparently liked an America where LGBT citizens weren t granted equal protection under the law as guaranteed in the 14th Amendment. They apparently liked an America where people didn t have affordable access to healthcare. They apparently liked no consumer protections from credit card companies.Kudos to AnybodybutTrump.us who hired the skywriter to display this messages of derision against Donald Trump, good on you. Donald Trump is disgusting, and America is already great, and hopefully will get even better with the election of another Democrat in November.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 1, 2016"
" Tired Of Things Going Well, Marco Rubio Makes Promise To Destroy America Again (VIDEO)","Listening to several of the Republican candidates for president, one could wonder if they ve been in a cryogenic sleep for the past seven years, and they re still talking about how badly George W. Bush screwed things up. However, no, they keep repeating the lie that the nation is so much worse now than it was at the brink of a recession before President Obama took over. Republican voters should honestly be insulted by this, being treated like idiots absent from reality. Although, maybe they are idiots absent to reality, and these Republican candidates are just being opportunistic.Repeating this lie of  seven disastrous years  of Obama, Marco Rubio took to the media branch of the GOP, Fox News, to give a quick campaign message and offer his well wishes for the new year. Hi, this is Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, and a candidate for President of the United States. As we leave 2015 behind and look forward to 2016, with the elections that are coming up in November, this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around. After seven disastrous years of the current president, we have a chance to reclaim the American dream, and that s why I m running for president. And my resolution for 2016 is to do everything I can to not just restore the American dream, but to expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. So that this, the greatest country in the world, can be greater than it s ever been. So, what America does Rubio want to go back to, exactly? One where people are losing their homes? One where jobs are lost at a rate of 750,000 per month? One where people could be denied healthcare for a preexisting condition? One where the 14th amendment is ignored and marriage equality doesn t exist? One where Osama bin Laden is still alive? One where credit card companies can still screw customers over left and right?Honestly, what does Rubio want to do to  turn America around,  because it sure as hell looks as though we are headed in the right direction, and if anything could stand a candidate to continue Obama s progress and advance it further.Rubio apparently wants an America where Wall Street runs the show, people die or go bankrupt from lack of health coverage, and Americans aren t treated equally under the law. So, if that s the America Rubio wants   thanks, but no thanks. .@marcorubio:  This is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around.  #FoxNews2016 https://t.co/yvze0WpCKg  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 1, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Here’s What The Fracking Industry Gave To Oklahoma In 2015 (IMAGES),"The fracking industry has given the state of Oklahoma a new claim to fame that no one in Oklahoma wanted. In 2015, Oklahoma had more earthquakes than the entire continental United States combined. There were 857 earthquakes in Oklahoma with a magnitude of 3.0 or higher. The total number of earthquakes for the continental United States with a 3.0 magnitude or higher was 1,556.Nearly two dozen peer reviewed, scientific papers have been published that show that there is a likely link between waste water injection wells used by the fracking industry and the increased number of quakes that have rocked the state.Oklahoma has seen a dramatic increase in the number of earthquakes over the past few years, that coincide with the state s fracking boom. In 2014, there were 585 quakes, a record for the state. In 2013, there were a comparatively stable 106.Here is a chart that shows the rising number of earthquakes. It is important to note that there were 84 less quakes in 2015 than was projected. As devastating as the quakes can be for the local population, they are also a matter of national security.  The small town of Cushing, Oklahoma is considered a top target for terrorist attacks. That s because Cushing is the largest oil hub in North America. Cushing holds a considerable amount of crude oil. Bloomberg reports that some of the tanks can fit a Boeing 747 jet inside of them. Though they are generally used to store around 10 million barrels of crude oil. On Oct. 10, 2015 a 4.5 earthquake occurred just three mules from Cushing.The irony that a process used to extract oil is putting the United States  largest oil hub in grave danger, should not be lost on anyone.In 2015, the ban on oil exports was lifted, setting the stage for increased use of fracking in the United States, far more so than what was already expected to occur.Featured Image Credit: Oklahoma Office Of The Secretary Of Energy & Environment via Ecowatch",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Pastafarian Fights Georgia For Right To Wear Colander In License Photo — Will Probably Win,"Pastafarianism is a fairly new religion. Its adherents are atheistic in belief, and they worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The religion took off in 2005, founded by Bobby Henderson in response to the Kansas Board of Education s decision to allow so-called  Intelligent Design    which is nothing more than biblical creationism in a very transparent disguise   to be taught as a valid point of view in public schools. Ever since the religion became popular with non believers everywhere, Pastafarians have been fighting for the same rights that every other religion has   including the right to wear religious headgear in driver s license photos. For Pastafarians that means wearing colanders in their photos.The latest fight in this arena comes from Chris Avino of Georgia. Avino was allowed to wear the colander in a temporary driver s license photo, but the decision was reversed for the picture that would be used on his permanent document. Officials insist that the state of Georgia  does not deem it appropriate to allow customers to be issued identification cards of licenses that portray satirical or offensive points of view.  This ruling comes courtesy of Angelique McClendon, an attorney for Georgia s Georgia Department of Driver Services. McClendon s decision comes because she says that while headdresses, scarves, and veils can be worn in photos for religious purposes, that a colander is not a veil, scarf or headdress. A colander is a kitchen utensil commonly used for  washing or draining food. McClendon also went on to condemn Pastafarianism altogether, saying that it is  not a religion,  but instead philosophy that mocks religion. Avino, however, took his cause to Twitter, and seems to be considering taking the state through the legal system regarding his religious right to wear his colander. He answered McClendon s ruling by saying: Just because a colander is not traditionally used as a headdress does not mean that it cannot serve that purpose. In fact, it does serve that purpose for the tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of believers who claim Pastafarianism as their religion.You may find our beliefs to be strange, but as strange as you may feel they are, they are still our beliefs. Some may find it strange that Christians believe that Jonah spent  3 days in a whale s belly  according to some texts. Some may find it strange that Muslims believe that Muhammad was carried to the seven heavens on the back of a winged horse. Some may find it strange that Scientologists believe that Xenu, the dictator of the Galactic Confederacy brought billions of people to earth in a DC-8-like spacecraft, stacked them around volcanoes, and killed them with hydrogen bombs. Maybe you, the reader of this letter, do not personally believe that Muhammad flew to heaven on a winged horse, but do you question the validity of Islam as a religion? He went on to make the very valid point that it is not up to the state to decide which religions deserved recognition, and that if they recognize one, they must recognize all. Our religion exists. It is legitimate. It s claims are no less valid than the claims of other recognized religions. I am in no way breaking the law or breaking any rules by wearing my religion s headdress, a colander, during my driver s license photo. But DDS is. DDS is infringing on my 1st amendment right to express my religious beliefs freely within the laws of the United States of America, within the laws of the state of Georgia, and within the rules of the DDS. The thing is, when you strip away the commonality and acceptance of mainstream religions like Christianity and such without question, they are no more valid than Pastafarianism. There is not a shred of evidence that any of them are true. Therefore, if Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and others get recognition, Pastafarianism should as well. Chris Avino is right. It is not up to the state to decide that his religion deserves no recognition. All religions are equally ridiculous, and I champion his right to wear his colander.Sue the pants off them, Mr. Avino, and wear your religious colander with pride.Featured image via Twitter/Raw Story",News,"January 1, 2016"
 FL ‘Responsible Gun Owners’ Shoot 9-Year-Old Girl During ‘Celebratory’ New Year’s Gunfire (VIDEO),"A bunch of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  in Florida rang in the new year with gunfire   something that had a very negative impact on at least one little girl s ability to enjoy herself. As she was leaving an Orlando church just after midnight, a massive amount of gunfire rang out. Was ISIS attacking? Nope. Was there yet another mass shooting happening? Negative. Was the American Taliban celebrating New Year s Day by wildly firing their weapons? Bingo.As the girl was exiting the service at a church on the 800 block of South Kirkman Road, the was struck in the right arm by a bullet, according to police. Law enforcement says that the girl was not targeted   the bullet came from one of many individuals who were wildly firing their  self-defense  weapons into the air in celebration of the holiday. There are many ways to enjoy the New Year, but firing random shots in the air should not be among them,  Orange County Sheriff Demings in a statement. Unfortunately, police do not think a suspect can be found because the round that struck the little girl seemed to be from the voluminous amounts of gunfire  happening at the time of this senseless shooting.Firing a gun in public or on a residential property is a crime, and can range from a first-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony. Unfortunately, the nation s ammosexuals do not care much about laws regarding guns, with many demanding that gun sellers ignore Obama s planned executive action to keep these dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who should not have them   a group that probably includes every single person who felt the appropriate way to ring in the new year is by randomly firing their guns and almost killing a child.The little girl was treated on the scene by the Orlando Fire Department, and is expected to recover from her injuries   fortunately.Watch a report on this senseless shooting below:Featured image via Guns.com",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Judge Serves A Crushing Blow To The Florida GOP That Could Change The State’s Color,"A Leon Circuit Judge in Florida has adopted a map of Florida Senate districts that is a huge win for voter s rights groups and a crushing blow to one of the most heinously corrupt political systems in the country. Florida registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. The state has a history of pulling off wins for Democrats like Barack Obama and Al Gore. The latter is proof of what the state is also famous for.Florida has a sad history of voter suppression. College students and new residents turned away because they either kept their home state license or hadn t switched it yet. It was OK to register, sorry, you just can t vote. Long lines and refusals are commonplace, as are difficult to read ballots. then there were the chads. Hundreds of thousands of votes tossed aside because of hanging chads.So why is the redistricting of Florida s Senate so important? it gives the Democrats a shot at a one-seat majority. Taking half of the legislative power in the state is the first step to maintaining Florida as a solidly purple state. Purple states tend to turn blue in presidential election years, and with a little bit of down-ballot voting, a Democrat could see the Governor s mansion.Florida s house districts were recently redrawn as well, but the more than 20 seat supermajority Republicans hold is from the rural districts where the south is still the south and everyone else be damned. Still, a purple Florida could lead to exciting advances in both the US House and Senate. Marco Rubio has shown what his service to his country means by abandoning his post. He doesn t want to play senator anymore, he wants to play president.That s the kind of quality  red  thinking we ve seen from Florida since the 1990s. We get to sit and listen to Jeb! brag about how great the Florida economy was when he was governor, never once mentioning that it was built on a bubble of real estate and construction. It was called a  boom.  Every tradesman known to man went into business for himself and made three phone calls, scheduled 6 months at a time of whatever it was they did and went to work.When the bubble exploded and the bottom fell out, thanks to further deregulation by brother George among other things, Florida was left in shambles; the housing market decimated. Banks went into mass foreclosure mode on such a scale that it will never truly be settled. Neighborhoods were abandoned as tradesmen lost their livelihoods almost overnight.This is the Republican plan in action because Florida is so strict with their building licenses and the costs with required insurances went so high that those enterprising tradesmen ended up working for big companies or leaving the state altogether when things started turning around. Many who lost everything found themselves working for half or less of what they were making before the crash.Florida deserves a break. Far too much idiocy comes from Florida conservatives. Or have we forgotten: George Zimmerman. Florida has a shot at redemption if those people who are registered Democrats get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket.Featured image via redstate.com ",News,"January 1, 2016"
" Bill Cosby Thanks ‘Friends And Fans’ In New Year’s Tweet, Twitter EVISCERATES Him (TWEETS)","Bill Cosby was America s favorite dad for a long time. However, there was a dark side to the comedian and television icon s legacy. For years, there have been whispers that Cosby was drugging and sexually assaulting young women, many of whom were young, starstruck, naive and believed that Cosby could help with their entertainment careers.In recent times, though, Cosby s alleged dirty deeds came back to haunt him, and nearly 60 women came forward to reveal to the world what he had done. Finally, with the statute of limitations on one of the cases just days from running out, Cosby was arrested for sexual assault.On New Year s Eve, Cosby sent out a tweet to his  friends and fans,  who support him despite the damning evidence against him and the huge number of women saying he violated them. While there are certainly many Cosby apologists out there, most people at this point believe the women. It turned out that sending this tweet was definitely the wrong thing to do. Twitter pounced on the disgraced star as he, in my opinion, so richly deserved:@BillCosby I get the friends and fans things, Bill, but what do you say to the victims?

However, considering the fact that he admitted under oath that he used quaaludes on women he wanted to have sex with well, let s just say the cards are stacked against him.This really just goes to show that America has a major issue with victim blaming and refusal to believe women who are victimized, especially when a beloved celebrity is the one being accused. Being rich and famous with a lot of fans and influence should not mean that one is above the law, and that is what has been the case with Cosby for years. Yes, he should have his day in court   but so should the victims. Justice is what is important here, not a television legacy.Featured image via Bill Cosby Twitter/Raw Story",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Obama Announces ‘Unfinished Business’ For 2016 And The Right Will Hate It (VIDEO),"President Obama began the new year of 2016 with a video asking for the nation s help in fighting one of its biggest problems: gun violence.In his weekly presidential address Obama ran through the accomplishments of his administration from 2009 to present, including job creation, expansion of health insurance, lowered oil costs, and marriage equality. Then he spoke about the  unfinished business  of fighting the epidemic of gun violence.Last month, we remembered the third anniversary of Newtown. This Friday, I ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery from the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day.Obama then noted that even though a majority of homes support policies to expand background checks   even homes with NRA members   the Republican congress refuses to move ahead at the behest of the well-financed National Rifle Association.As a result, Obama notes that  tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence. But even though its his last year in office, the President is not going to stand still on the issue, despite the threat of backlash from the NRA.A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I ll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options. Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.Obama doesn t have to do this, he could sit in office for the next 12 months on his laurels and just accept the achievements that he s accomplished. But he clearly wants to do more, and he s going to get it done.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Damning New Evidence Shows How Israel Bribed Republican Traitors To Sabotage Obama On Iran Deal,"You probably can recall the huge diplomatic mess that Republicans made last year, by sending an  open letter  to Iran in an effort to sour President Obama s negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program. The letter was a clear shot at the deal the White House had been working on since the very early days of President Obama s time in office. Republicans attempted to frame any agreements Iran would make with Obama as  not guaranteed  to continue once he leaves office. This, in addition to the invitation of Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress without the approval of the White House, put negotiations at a real risk. Many thought that it would push circumstances to where Israel would unilaterally conduct military strikes against Iran, which is a situation nobody wanted to see happen.The reaction was fast and harsh by many in America, who saw it as an unprecedented move that bordered on outright treason by Republicans. It got so bad that even some Republicans who signed off on the letter were having second thoughts as to how bright of an idea it was.Benjamin Netanyahu openly admitted to lobbying Congress for help to scuttle the deal. However, he never discussed direct contact that the Israeli government had with congressional members or the offers that were made to them. Now, with these new revelations, it shows damning evidence that this is exactly what Israel and Republicans did.Scathing new reports, which were made possible from leaked NSA wiretapping, show how Israel communicated directly with members of Congress. It proves that Netanyahu and his cohorts were attempting to essentially bribe Republicans into sabotaging the diplomatic efforts of a sitting United States president. A U.S. intelligence official who was involved in managing the NSA intercepts said Israel s communications with Republicans included such questions as:  How can we get your vote? What s it going to take?  What further denial of treason can be made by either Republicans or Israel at this point?Judging from the Republican course of action on this matter, we can see that Israel met with success. While no  smoking gun  has been uncovered yet in these releases, you don t have to be any kind of political genius to understand that America s broken campaign finance system would allow for Israel to pay handsomely for Republican services. All Israel and Netanyahu had to do was send money through middlemen, or call in some favors stateside requesting donations be sent to certain interests.Even though Israel continues to deny that they were spied upon, the implications are obvious. A foreign government directly accessed elected members of the U.S. Congress and offered them bribes to sabotage diplomatic processes in place with another nation. There is no more clear a case for treason that can be made.Thankfully, Israel and the Republican party did not succeed this time. The deal is in place, and Iran just released tons of its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia, ensuring that it would not be crafted into a bomb. Iran will not be enriching any new uranium for the next 15 years, it will be reducing its centrifuge capacity for future enrichment by two-thirds, and it will diminish its current stockpile of enriched uranium by an estimated ninety-seven percent.There is a poetic justice to be had by President Obama on this issue. When he received the Nobel Peace prize early in his first term, practically every Republican erupted in jealousy saying he didn t deserve it. Admittedly, anyone can see the prize was given to Obama as well as America for moving off the path of the Bush warmongering years. Now that President Obama has achieved nothing short of a historic victory in dealing with Iran, nobody can try to suggest he has not earned his prize.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 1, 2016"
" Ben Carson Campaign In Shambles After Top Aides, 20 Staffers Quit","It s not looking like much of a Happy New for republican presidential candidate Ben Carson.Carson, who has been nosediving in the polls since November, woke up on New Year s Eve to a resignation phone call from his campaign s top adviser, Barry Bennett. But that was just the beginning of the candidate s troubles.Shortly after Bennett resigned, Carson s Communications Director, Doug Watts, also handed in his resignation.That was followed by the resignation of his Deputy Campaign Manager, Lisa Coen.Just when it looked as if things couldn t get much worse, 20 additional staffers followed Carson s former top advisers out the door.The walk-out follows accusations that Carson s campaign is little more than a  money-making scheme  spearheaded by an unethical conservative commentator named Armstrong Williams. Williams biggest claim to fame is that he was secretly paid more than $240,000 by the George Bush administration to unethically promote the President s signature No Child Left Behind policy. Interestingly, Williams is not only Carson s campaign manager, but also his business manager.As Raw Story reported back in November, Carson began facing allegations about the sincerity of his campaign after he bypassed opportunities to engage voters in early primary states, in favor of a tour to promote his most recent book.In an article published in New York Magazine, staff writer Jonathan Chait asked whether Ben Carson is really running for president, or simply running a money-making con scheme.Chait pointed out that, Conservative politics are so closely intermingled with a lucrative entertainment complex that it is frequently impossible to distinguish between a political project (that is, something designed to result in policy change) and a money-making venture. He then went on to discuss the potential benefits of announcing that you re running for president, even if you don t actually want to be president. Declaring yourself a presidential candidate gives you access to millions of dollars  worth of free media attention that can build a valuable brand. So the mere fact that Carson calls himself a presidential candidate does not prove he is actually running for president rather than taking advantage of the opportunity to build his brand. Indeed, it is possible to be actually leading the polls without seriously trying to win the presidency. What Chait discovered about Carson s campaign was that it has all the tell-tale signs of a scam. Carson is doing a lot of things that seem puzzling for a presidential campaign, but quite logical for a brand-building exercise. He is taking weeks off the campaign trail to go on a book tour. His campaign itself is structured much more like a scamming venture than a political one. An astronomical 69 percent of his fund-raising totals are spent on more fund-raising. (Bernie Sanders, by contrast, spends just 4 percent of his intake on fund-raising.) In addition to direct mail, Carson seems to have undertaken a massive phone-spamming operation. Spending most of your money to raise more money is not a good way to get elected president, but it is a good way to build a massive list of supporters that can later be monetized. Perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for Armstrong Williams, the figure running the Carson  campaign,  is  business manager,  as opposed to  campaign manager.  It does suggests that Carson is engaged in a for-profit venture. Today as Carson s staffers began abandoning ship in droves, they left no doubt about their reasons.Bennett placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of Armstrong. He noted that the Carson campaign has raised more money this quarter than any other Republican candidate.And yet according to the most recent polling data, Carson lags some 27 points behind Republican front runner Donald Trump.It doesn t add up, and it seems that a lot of his staffers know it.In a final stab, seemingly aimed at the lack of sincerity and professionalism within the Carson campaign, Bennett said during an interview with Reuters, I can play amateur politics at home with my 9-year-old. I don t need to do it at the professional level. Featured image credit: Gage Skidmore via Flckr",News,"January 1, 2016"
Democrat Senator Warns Mueller Not To Release Findings On Russia Before 2018 Midterms,"According to The Hill, Democrat Senator Bob Casey is warning special counsel Robert Mueller against issuing his Russia report near the 2018 electionSen. Bob Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) on Sunday warned special counsel Robert Mueller against issuing a report on his findings in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election near the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Speaking to radio host John Catsimatidis on New York radio station AM 970, Casey said he couldn t make any assumptions about where the Mueller investigation is going in light of indictments issued on Friday. But he added that he would recommend Mueller not release a report on his findings near the midterms when it would distract from elections or cause people to question the election s integrity. I don t think we ll know anywhere near the full story until [Mueller] issues his report,  Casey said.  But once you get into the summer, and you get close to the election, I think it s a mistake for him to release it late. I think you should wait until after [the election]  Casey said.

GOTCHA! A Stammering John Podesta Stunned by a REAL Question from CBS Reporter,"John Podesta is Hillary Clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird. That s why this is such a fun video to watch. Podesta had a brutal exchange on CBS s  Face the Nation  on Sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on so-called  purple states  in 2016.Host Nancy Cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday showed that Russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests. Then she goes in for the kill with this question: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin and your campaign didn t?  LOL! That s such a great snark-filled question!TRANSCRIPT OF FULL INTERVIEW:NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to  Face the Nation.  I m Nancy Cordes. Our next guest, John Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign. His private emails were hacked and released publicly by Russian-backed entities during the campaign. Mr. Podesta, thank you so much for being with us.JOHN PODESTA: Nice to be back, Nancy.NANCY CORDES: For anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton, these new indictments mean what?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, it s a tragedy for the American people, really. As Mr. Mueller said in his indictment, this was an act of information warfare against the United States, against our democracy. So I think it s, obviously, disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these Russian active measures, but I think the real victims here are the American people because there, there was direct interference with our democratic institutions.NANCY CORDES: The deputy attorney general was very careful on Friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election. You ve had a lot time think about this, where do you come down on that issue?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, this was one part of a, of a complex, active interference in the measures. This didn t even deal with the hacking, this was only about what was going on in the social media and the, and the information campaign that was being done there, but there were 80 people, millions of dollars spent. And as one of your previous guests, Senator Coons noted, we won the popular vote by three million votes. They were pushing votes, just to give one example, to Jill Stein. Her vote in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin was greater than the gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in those states. So you can t prove that it did affect the outcome, but it certainly seems likely that it had some impact.NANCY CORDES: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and your campaign didn t?JOHN PODESTA: Well, of course, we spent a lot of time, energy, and effort in all those states.NANCY CORDES: Hillary Clinton, herself, did not spend much time in those states.JOHN PODESTA: We, you know, we had   Tim Kaine was there, Barack Obama was in   and she spent enormous time in Pennsylvania and Michigan.NANCY CORDES: Sure.JOHN PODESTA: And we spent a lot of effort. We had more staff in Wisconsin than even President Obama had in 2012. But, but I think that begs the question, I think we, we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest, and at the end of the day, we fell short in those states. And I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in, in Donald Trump s favor. But I think what the real issue is, is how he s reacted to that. And in that context, if we re   if this is information warfare, then I think he s the first draft-dodger in the war. I mean, he has done nothing but tried to undermine the Mueller investigation, he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he   was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the, to the activities in the 2016 election. We learned this week, he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the 2018 election.NANCY CORDES: Why do you think that is? Do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the Russians might have influenced this election?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, I think that Mr. Trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot, a lot about it, but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him, and I think he just constantly tries to move the ball away, including what was, I think, really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the FBI for investigating the Russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in Florida. But you know who knows with Mr. Trump? But he clearly, I think, has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the United States, which is to protect our democracy.NANCY CORDES: Midterm elections are coming up, and it s been reported that Democrats are telling your former boss, Bill Clinton, that in light of the Me Too movement, they, they think he should sit it out, he should be benched, and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them. Is that true? And do you think that that s the right call?JOHN PODESTA: Look, I think he remains, I think, a figure who is popular with a lot of Democrats across the country. And I think that people are calling him, candidates are calling him and asking for advice. But whether he s going to be an active participant, I think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now. I think he s doing other things, and, and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaign.NANCY CORDES: Do you think it s a good idea, very quickly, for him to sit it out?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, look, I think that, that if I was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do, I would, I would sort of judge whether he can be helpful. And I think some places he can be, and probably some places he s more of a lightning rod.NANCY CORDES: All right, John Podesta, thank you so much. Campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And we ll be right back with our panel of Republicans who are leaving the House and Senate.",politics,18-Feb-18
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER Makes “Shooting At Trump” Option For Answer On Multiple Choice Test,"EAG News  A Wyoming high school is under fire after parents exposed an online student quiz that offered  shooting at Trump  as one of the multiple choice answers.An unidentified English teacher at Jackson Hole High School gave students a multiple choice quiz on Thursday about George Orwell s novel  Animal Farm  that included a question that many are pointing to as an example of the district s  liberal bias,  the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. Napoleon has a gun fired for a new occasion. What is the new occasion?  the quiz read.Possible answers included  He was shooting at Trump,   His birthday,   For completion of the windmill,  or  To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm. Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test. I had to read it two times,  McCollum said.  I was like,  Are you kidding me? McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments. It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question,  he said.  To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all. He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of  liberal bias  in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be  the outcast. He told me,  Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in,  McCollum said of his son.  Rylee is very patriotic, very supportive of our military and of our country  and is considering enlisting in the U.S. Marines.School officials eventually issued a statement about the quiz on Monday. (District) administration learned late yesterday that a quiz was administered to a class of high school students that contained an inappropriate answer to a multiple choice question. Administration is investigating this incident and verifying the information we have received,  the statement read. (The District) takes seriously threats of any kind, regardless of the intent. We apologize to the students, families, and community for this incident and will be addressing the issue with personnel. It s unclear what, if any, discipline the teacher may face.The incident occurred in the Teton County School District #1.According to The Washington Post:Last year, deeply conservative Wyoming voted for Trump by the widest majority of any state, 70 percent. In Teton County, Hillary Clinton got 60 percent, the only Wyoming county the Democrat won.Teton County is a wealthy ski and summer recreation destination. Residents include former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney.In 2015, school administrators canceled an  America Day  tradition for homecoming in which students donned red, white and blue and rode around on a diesel truck to show their patriotism and love of country. Activities director Mike Hansen put the kibosh on the event because he alleged some students might get offended.The school s juniors and seniors didn t buy it, however, and many showed up to school decked out in stars and stripes, then paraded the diesel truck around the school parking lot at the end of the day, waving American flags. It s homecoming week and our school administration thought it was too  offensive  to have an America Pride Day! So this is my kids answer to that!  local parent Ted Dawson posted to Facebook with pictures of his kids in patriotic get-ups.  Where have we gone wrong!

Rob Goldman tweeted about how the media has been trying to promote a false narrative about how the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, when in fact, that s not at all what happened.Goldman tweeted about special counsel Robert Mueller s indictment of 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian entities for alleged interference in our 2016 presidential election.The indictment says that a Russian organization called the Internet Research Agency sought to wage  information warfare  against the United States and to  sow discord  in the American political system by using fictitious American personas and social media platforms and other Internet-based media.Internet Research Agency, a so-called  troll farm  based in St. Petersburg, Russia,  was allegedly controlled by a defendant in the indictment named Yevgeny Progozhin, who is a wealthy associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  CNBCVery excited to see the Mueller indictment today. We shared Russian ads with Congress, Mueller and the American people to help the public understand how the Russians abused our system. Still, there are keys facts about the Russian actions that are still not well understood.  Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn t align with the main media narrative of Tump and the election. https://t.co/2dL8Kh0hof  Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018Facebook s VP of ads then tweeted about how the majority of the ad spend took place AFTER the election. He then landed a verbal molotov cocktail at our dishonest press, as he pointed out that Facebook shared that fact, but the mainstream media didn t cover it because it doesn t align with their narrative of Trump and the election.Goldman went on to explain that the main goal of the Russian propaganda campaign is to divide Americans by using free speech against us on social media. Goldman claims they are stoking  fear and hatred amongst Americans. The main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation.  Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018President Trump retweeted Goldman s tweet:The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018Here s a screenshot of Trump s tweet:Finally, Goldman tweeted a real and scary example of how the Russians are using fake propaganda on social media to intentionally divide United States citizens:The single best demonstration of Russia's true motives is the Houston anti-islamic protest. Americans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both the sides of protest. https://t.co/9w1EAl28CH  Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018The only thing Goldman got wrong, is the reason our nation is so deeply divided. It actually has little to do with Russian bots or social media operatives. Our nation is divided because we had a president that for 8 years worked behind the scenes, meeting with radical hate groups like BLM and underground Democratic Party groups like the one headed up by felon Rob Creamer whose purpose was to disrupt and create violence and chaos at Trump rallies across America.Goldman also tweeted a very recent example of how Russian operatives are attempting to divide Americans on a very heated issue, gun control.Russia-linked bots are promoting pro-gun messages on Twitter in an attempt to sow discord in the aftermath of the Florida school shooting, monitoring groups say https://t.co/67K6UIZzcJ pic.twitter.com/uDqCWQp4lo  CNN (@CNN) February 17, 2018According to CNBC, the indictment said the Internet Research Agency was registered with the Russian government as a corporate entity in 2013, and by May 2014 the group s strategy included interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with the stated goal of  spread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,  the indictment said.The indictment details an extremely sophisticated conspiracy in which defendants traveled to the United States to conduct research, employed specialists to fine-tune social media posts to  ensure they appeared authentic,  and stole real people s identities to purchase online ads.",politics,17-Feb-18
MEGHAN MCCAIN Cut-Off After Saying the Florida Shooter was “Flagged by the FBI” [Video],"It clear that common sense isn t what these hens want to hear. Common sense would tell anyone that the FBI dropped the ball with the Florida shooter. watch as Meghan McCain is shut down after making the best argument for how the Florida shooting could have been avoided:Meghan McCain got cut off on  The View  Friday after telling her co-hosts that the Florida school shooter was  flagged by the FBI  and nothing happened.The comment came during a discussion about gun control following the deadly shooting Wednesday in Parkland, Florida, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a 19-year-old man opened fire at school killing 17 people, including teachers and students before being taken into custody.Daily caller reports: The argument from NRA members and Second Amendment supporters is much like abortion. Not a lot of trust on both sides for compromise,  McCain explained.  I m like okay, we can talk about assault weapons. That being said, I know people who own them who obviously aren t mass murderers. They re hunters and use they them for target practice and hunting. And it s like if you give a mouse a cookie then we are going to go to..it s a slippery slope going forward. Much like abortion, It s so emotional on both sides, I think it s hard for people on both sides to have faith that we can meet in the middle. With all due respect you didn t grow up in gun country,  McCain explained.A short time later, McCain said no one is in support of people with mental illness having guns and that this shooter was flagged by the FBI and  still nothing happened.

"“THE TRUMP CURSE IS REAL”…Social Media Responds To Lindsey Vonn’s Olympic Loss, After Saying She’d Boycott White House If She Won Medal","Two months before the Winter Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn claimed she would be representing the United States, but not President Trump, when she returned to the Winter Games.Vonn, who won a gold medal in the women s downhill competition in 2010 in Vancouver, skipped the 2014 Sochi games because of knee injuries. I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the president,  Vonn said this week amid the buildup to the 2018 games in PyeongChang, South Korea.  FOX NewsVonn s ridiculous and unnecessary comments threw her into the middle of a nasty controversy on social media. Unfortunately, with one hateful statement, Vonn managed to alienate a large number of fans who were rooting for her to bring home the gold for the United States. If she didn t already know, someone should have told Vonn that U.S. Olympic athletes are supposed to be representing the United States of America, and not the President of the United States. Only three days after Vonn s statement about boycotting President Trump s invitation to the White House, she suffered a back injury that caused her to lose the World Cup race, as she placed 24th in the competition.Yesterday, Vonn, 33, lost her first Olympic race in eight years after a late mistake that cost her a medal. Americans responded to her loss on social media, reminding her of her desire to make her race about her hate for Donald Trump instead of about representing America.Here s how Vonna responded to her loss on Twitter:Frustrating to be so close to the podium and to have made such a big mistake but that s ski racing. I m proud of the way I skied and how I attacked the course. I gave it my all and came up short. That s life.

Michelle Rachford (@Mikki_Michelle_) February 17, 2018Lindsey Vonn responded to Foudy, who again defended Vonn. The only problem is, Vonn forgets that she is the person who started the controversy. She decided to make the race about politics, not President Trump and certainly not his supporters:Vonn tweeted:  It s ok Julie. Not everyone has to like me but my family loves me and I sleep well at night. I work hard and try to be the best person I can be.

"How The Left, The Anti Defamation League and Media Used Fake Information To Publish HUGE LIE About High School Killer’s Ties To “White Nationalist”","Immediately after the police identified the suspect in the Florida high school massacre, as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, the media began to scour social media, desperate to find any ties Cruz may have had to the  Right . In the media s narrow minds, you can t be a gun owner and not be tied to the Republican Party. The Republican Party and the NRA must be held accountable, and they must be held accountable at all costs, even at the cost of being accurate or truthful. When the media couldn t find any facts to report, they immediately began to scour social media for hints.  What they got was a bunch of social media trolls who thought it would be funny to lead the mainstream media on with lies about the shooter. The mainstream media and the Anti Defamation League (who ironically, claims to defend people who are victims of discrimination, yet works overtime to demonize anyone whose views are to the right of theirs), had to settle for fake ties to the massacre suspect and  white supremacist  group in Tallahassee, Florida.Unfortunately, both the media and the Anti Defamation League s stories quickly fell apart when they were outed for not having done their homework to properly vet the comments made on an open chat, social media platform called 4Chan.On Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.From the Anti Defamation League s website:A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) claimed to the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz, the man charged with the previous day s deadly shooting spree at a Parkland, Florida, high school, was associated with his group.UPDATE: On Thursday afternoon, following news reports of the alleged association between Cruz and the Republic of Florida, a member of an alt right discussion forum wrote that all of the claims were false and were part of an elaborate attempt to troll a network news reporter and other media outlets. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, the Broward County sheriff said a connection was  not confirmed at this time,  but that law enforcement was still investigating.Cruz, 19, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, allegedly entered the school Wednesday, February 14 with an AR-15 and opened fire, killing at least 17 people and injuring 14 more. Cruz left the scene but was later captured by police and has been charged with premeditated murder.After self-described ROF members claimed on the discussion forum 4chan that Cruz had also been a member, the Anti-Defamation League spoke with an ROF member who identified himself as Jordan Jereb.Jereb, based in Tallahassee, is believed to be the leader of ROF.  In 2016, he was arrested on charges of threatening a staffer in the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott because he was allegedly angry at the staffer s son.Jereb said that Cruz was associated with ROF, having been  brought up  by another member.  Jereb also claimed that Cruz had participated in one or more ROF training exercises in the Tallahassee area, carpooling with other ROF members from south Florida.ROF has members in north and south Florida. The alt right white supremacist group borrows paramilitary concepts from the anti-government extremist militia movement (not itself a white supremacist movement).  ROF describes itself as a  white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics  and seeks to create a  white ethnostate  in Florida.  Most ROF members are young and the group itself is only a few years old.Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting.If Cruz s role is confirmed, the Parkland school shooting would be the second school shooting by a white supremacist in the past two months. In December 2017, another young white supremacist, William Atchison, engaged in a shooting spree at a high school in northwest New Mexico, killing two students before shooting himself.What we know about ROF (the Republic of Florida): A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [ .] was associated with his group,  the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee. Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,  the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim.Some outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.But a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a  misunderstanding  and that he, too, had been the subject of a  prank.  On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed. Politico reports-  All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,  said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.The ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. ADL shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events,  an ADL spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.  Confirmation of whether Cruz was part of ROF is now in the hands of law enforcement, and that s what the Broward sheriff s team is looking into. The ADL traced its original tip to posts on 4chan, where researchers found  self-described ROF members  claiming that Cruz was a brother-in-arms. But many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researchers.On Wednesday, an anonymous 4chan user posted about receiving a message on Instagram from an ABC News reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew Cruz. Prime trolling opportunity,  another user replied. You have to take advantage of this,  a third chimed in.He asked for proof of the reporter s identity, according to posted screenshots from their correspondence. The reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an ABC identification badge.Some on the 4chan thread joked about sending back obscene photos, but others gave concrete tips for tricking the reporter:  Keep talking to her so she gains your trust ;  Keep this going be realistic   say you have known him for years you met him on a Liberal Facebook page years ago and you have kept in touch ;  Say you are scared to tell her in case you get blamed, it will get her excited you know something big. This particular 4chan user seems to have sent the reporter a racist cartoon and was quickly blocked. Many on the forum ripped into him for missing a  a golden opportunity. ",politics,17-Feb-18
LOOK WHO Approved Visas For Russian Operatives To Enter US And Interfere In Election,"According to Fox News  A federal grand jury on Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that detailed a sophisticated plot to wage  information warfare  against the U.S.The Russian nationals are accused of setting a  strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election. The indictment   the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller s probe   effectively returns focus to the meddling activities out of Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, following a string of charges relating to the actions of Trump associates.Further, the DOJ made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, said at a Friday press conference.President Trump reacted to the indictments by seizing on Rosenstein s comment that the election results were not impacted by the Russians  activity. Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,  Trump tweeted.  The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong   no collusion! Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President.

"HEY, BERNIE SANDERS: 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS Have NOT Happened This Year!","The left has locked onto a stat that 18 school shootings have happened this year. This is FAKE NEWS that needs to be shut down. Bernie Sanders and others referred to this statistic right after the Parkland mass shooting.Anti-gun groups included in the statistics a suicide at a school in Michigan that had been closed. This fake statistic trivializes the horrific crime that happened at Parkland or any other TRUE school shooting. EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY  TRIES TO HIJACK THE NARRATIVE:Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg backed anti-gun group founded after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was the original source for that particular statistic. The group s initial tweet claiming that the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was the 18th school shooting in 2018 has now been retweeted more than 1,200 times:Our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida today.This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018. https://t.co/YdPLz4zuOS  Everytown (@Everytown) February 14, 2018The group defines a school shooting is  any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds. ACCIDENTAL GUN DISCHARGES AND SUICIDES AREN T  SCHOOL SHOOTINGS It turns out that  Everytown s database turns up ridiculous examples that ARE NOT school shootings:On January 10,  gunshots, which most likely originated off-campus, hit a window of the visual arts building at California State University, San Bernardino. Classes were immediately canceled as the university went into lockdown, though a police search failed to turn up any shooter on campus.  On February 5, in a suburb of Minneapolis,  a school liaison officer was sitting on a bench talking with some students when a third-grader pressed the trigger on the officer s holstered weapon, causing it to fire and strike the floor.  Those were no doubt terrifying incidents for the people involved, and they may even have policy implications, but they are not what anyone thinks of when they hear the phrase  school shootings. But the media and several prominent politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), eagerly regurgitated the context-free statistic in the aftermath of the shooting in Florida, apparently without stopping to wonder why they hadn t heard about the other 17 school shootings that supposedly had happened since January 1.This isn t just an embarrassing case of confirmation bias. Spreading such misleading statistics affects how Americans from ordinary working people to elected officials understand and cope with these terrible incidents.",politics,16-Feb-18
TUCKER CARLSON Rips The Left On Gun Control Hysteria: “Let’s stop lying about this” [Video],"Tucker Carlson weighed in on the hysteria over gun control and where the blame lies for the school shooting in Florida.

Tucker Carlson calls them out on their lies: Let s stop lying about this. The calls we are hearing today for gun control have nothing to do with protecting Americans from violence. What you re witnessing is a kind of class war. The left hates rural America, red America, gun-owning America, the America that elected Donald Trump. They hate them. Progressives are still in charge of most of the major institutions in this country, and they despise the autonomy of an armed population. They want collective punishment for the sins of a few. They seek to obliterate a core constitutional right rather than trying to mitigate its downsides. They call it gun control, but it s not. It s people control.

WATCH SHERIFF’S Honest Response After a School Shooting: “The gun didn’t change…” [Video],"When it gets down to it, what this sheriff said is the heart of the problem.

Gun didn t change. We changed. Of course, he was brutally attacked for telling the truth. They said he blamed everything but the gun Yes he did.This young gentleman got sucked into a counterculture of violence, a culture that is enamored with school shootings. And media, you are to blame for that, because you keep giving these people headlines. You keep using their names. You have made them heroes to some people. If I had my way, none of these people s names would ever be remembered.Where did we really go sideways in raising our kids? Perhaps we taught them to glorify the wrong things. All this violence that they constantly consume has come home to pay a major price. It is time for each and every one of us to say no more to the hate that we see, to the violence that we see.Lawmakers on both the right and the left, you re both enamored by radicalized hate. You seem to hate everybody and everything. It s time for you to end that too.They [the federal government] have pushed this problem to the local level, and the local level is not equipped to deal with it. This is a state and national issue that they better wake up and start dealing with.You started glorifying cultures of violence. You glorified gang culture. You glorified games that actually give you points for raping and killing people. ",politics,16-Feb-18
"Flashback Video: Susan Rice Says Trump’s Claims He Was Wiretapped Absolutely False, “That Can Only Come From A FISA Court”","Susan Rice and Obama were as thick as thieves during his 8 years as president. In the video below, Rice lies about the spying on Trump without blinking an eye.

Do you know anything about this?SUSAN RICE, Former U.S. National Security Adviser:  I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. And let`s back up and recall where we have been. The president of the United States accused his predecessor, President Obama, of wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign. Nothing of the sort occurred, and we have heard that confirmed by the director of the FBI, who also pointed out that no president, no White House can order the surveillance of another American citizen. That can only come from the Justice Department, with the approval of a FISA court.",politics,16-Feb-18
POLITICS FIRST: LEFTIST PARENTS Of Former Combat Marine Running For GOP Senate Seat Max Out Donations To His DEMOCRAT Opponent,"The heartbreaking story of two parents who put their leftist ideology before their own son The parents of GOP Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson have maxed out their campaign contributions to the Democrat he s challenging, CNN reported Monday.Each of Nicholson s parents gave $2,700 to Sen. Tammy Baldwin s (D-Wis.) campaign in December, the largest amount they can give during the Democratic primary.Nicholson s mother, Donna, has been documented as giving thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years. However, this is the first gift either of his parents have made to Baldwin s campaign since Nicholson announced his own bid. My parents have a different worldview than I do, and it is not surprising that they would support a candidate like Tammy Baldwin who shares their perspective,  Nicholson said in a statement to CNN. I m a conservative today not because I was born one, but because of the experience I earned as a Marine in combat, my experience as a husband and father, my choice to be a Christian, the schools I chose to attend and the decision to pursue the career that I have,  he continued. Regardless of who may disagree with my life decisions, I would not trade these experiences for anything, and they will always guide my views as Wisconsin s next U.S. Senator. Nicholson announced in July that he would be running in the GOP primary for Baldwin s seat.He faced questions about his political views over his past position as president of the College Democrats of America and his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2000.However, Nicholson told Politico last year that he permanently changed parties after he served in Iraq in 2007. I knew what we were doing there,  he told Politico.  We were stabilizing that country. We made incredible amounts of progress. And what I was hearing back home was a complete and absolute lie, as politicians were running around calling it a failure.   The Hill",politics,15-Feb-18
TWO HIGH SCHOOL JROTC Members Tell INCREDIBLE Story Of How They Led Students Into Classroom…Used Tevlar Mats To Block Bullets From Florida Shooter [VIDEO],"ABC News  When two Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and Junior Reserve Officers  Training Corps (JROTC) captains heard gunshots after training with cadets, they used classroom materials to barricade and protect students.Company commander Capt. Zackary Walls, 17, and Capt. Colton Haab, 17, told ABC News that they ended formations early to head back to their classrooms shortly before a fire alarm went off and the shooting began. Around 2:30 I hear the bell ring for the fire alarm and we start heading out,  Walls said.  I m leading the line and we re heading out and it just so happens our fire zone was exactly where the shooter was,  but, Walls added, he did not see the shooter. I heard the first two or three shots, I knew it was gunshots and I look back at all the kids behind me, there s 60 kids looking at me [asking],  What do I do, where do I go  I just yell,  get back in the classroom,'  Walls said.He went on to explain that students were sprinting through the hallways  trampling over each other  and he began ushering them inside a classroom to shield them from the gunfire.  I start trying to just herd kids in there, get them to where they re not pushing and trampling each other and just get them into the room safely. I pulled in teachers, I pulled in kids that weren t in my class,  Walls recalled of the chaotic scene.Haab said his first sergeant told him not to lead his class outside after hearing seven gunshots, so he turned back to safety. I shut my door, pulled a student in and I brought him into the other room [where Walls was located] and I started getting people in,  Haab said.A student, who told ABC News that he participated in Junior ROTC with Cruz, described him as a  psycho.

That arrest followed a call to the DA s office from the NYPD saying that Germanotta was wanted for grand larceny in the third degree.According to the New York Post, a congressional candidate from Wisconsin was busted by the NYPD in her home state when she tried to sell a ring she ripped off from a Manhattan jewelry store, police said Wednesday.Juliet Germanotta   who in campaign literature vowed to keep the state  fiscally responsible by questioning expenses     had ordered a $4,800, 18-karat yellow gold Zambian emerald and diamond ring from Mikaelians Jewelry on West 47th Street in Midtown on Sept. 19.But Germanotta, 36, who describes herself as a  proud transgender woman,  claimed the ring she received was not to her liking and requested her money back from the store.Instead of sending the real ring back, she sent the store a $10 replica   and sold the original, cops said.Mikaelians filed a complaint with the NYPD on Oct. 2, recognizing the ring they received in return as a phony.

JUST IN: Senate Rejects Immigration Bill…Trump Calls a “Total Catastrophe”,"How could the Senate be so lame in their effort to produce an immigration bill? A Senator Ted Cruz put it,  they re to the left of Obama . Now that s pretty bad! what stuck out like sore thumb is the bill s failure to address chain migration that s a biggie!AHEAD OF THE VOTE: The DHS warned the plan would mean the  end of immigration enforcement in America. Senators on Thursday blocked multiple plans dealing with immigration as President Trump torpedoed one proposal as  a total catastrophe  and his Department of Homeland Security lambasted it as the  end of immigration enforcement in America. During a series of afternoon procedural votes, no immigration amendments crossed the 60 vote threshold that would have cut off debate and paved the way for final votes.The effort to pass immigration legislation comes as Democrats insist on protecting young illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and Trump demands funding for a border wall.Ahead of the votes, the Trump administration focused on the bipartisan agreement drawn up by a  Gang of 22  that would grant a 10-12 year path to the young illegal immigrants or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.The amendment failed by only getting 54 votes. Forty five senators voted against it.The administration objected to the bill s failure to address so-called  chain migration    by which immigrants can sponsor a broad number of relatives to come join them in the U.S. Trump has said that he wants to limit sponsorship to children and spouses.The bill also would not end the visa lottery system, which allows 55,000 immigrants into the country each year and has been dogged by accusations of fraud and abuse.The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be  the end of immigration enforcement in America.

The DIRTY TRUTH About DACA Recipients…Where They’re REALLY Coming From…Their CRIMINAL Records…And How They REALLY Got Here,"Yesterday, a second U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump s decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation.U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, cannot end in March as the Republican administration had planned, a victory for Democratic state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the federal government.The decision is similar to a Jan. 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation challenging Trump s decision continues.The legal battle over DACA complicates a debate currently underway in Congress on whether to change the nation s immigration laws.The Supreme Court on Friday is due to consider whether to take up the administration s appeal of the San Francisco ruling. The court could announce as soon as Friday afternoon whether it will hearing the case.  ReutersSince when does a judge unilaterally decide that a program based on an executive order by a radical and lawless president, with an expiration date, can be extended?Peel back the layers of lies that are being told to the American public by Democrats like Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, and their allies in the media, and discover the shocking truth about the  Dreamers (or voters) they re fighting so hard to keep in America.  According to The Hill, the narrative surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program holds that it was put in place to protect  kids  who were brought here through no fault of their own. DACA supporters implied that applicants were mostly Hispanic and that as citizens of distressed republics a short distance away from the wealthy United States, their violation of our immigration laws was somehow understandable. Program applicants were also portrayed as brilliant valedictorians and proud members of the military.From the outset, that narrative rang hollow. In a column for the Washington Post, Mickey Kaus described it as public-relations-style  hooey.  Here s why.New data released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) definitively establishes that most of the DACA narrative is false. Particularly overblown are claims that deported DACA recipients would inevitably be strangers in a strange land.USCIS lists 149 countries of origin for DACA applicants. English is the national language in at least 26 of those countries. Those include the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. A large number of applicants are from India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, where there are enormous English-speaking communities.Other statistics also undermine claims that the United States must  take care of the DACAs  or condemn them to a life of isolation and poverty.In fact, many DACA applicant s birth countries are listed on the higher end of the common standard of living indexes. Which means that DACA advocates are arguing that the United States has a moral obligation to undermine its own laws in order to avoid returning illegal aliens to countries whose citizens are considered to have a higher standard of living than many Americans.One wonders why it has never occurred to Congress that its primary obligation should be protecting native-born American kids from illegal aliens who compete with them for entry-level jobs and seats at colleges and universities. Curiously, our elected representatives seem remarkably unconcerned about protecting America s standard of living.What is most disturbing about the data released by USCIS, however, is the number of DACA applicants who come from countries associated with terrorism or overt anti-Americanism. This is cause for concern given the  lean and lite  vetting used to quickly approve DACA applications:Based on the facts   rather than the myth   it seems clear the individuals who applied for, and received, DACA were not the oppressed, well-meaning, high-achievers that the media and the open-borders lobby portrayed them to be.

JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didn’t Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video],"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS The Perfect New Years Message…It’s Who He Included In His Tweet That Has Everyone LAUGHING!,"As 2017 comes to a close, we d like to acknowledge our gratitude to President Trump, who is truly a gift to America. He came at a time when we needed him most. He came at a time when We The People were watching our freedoms and rights being stripped away by an out-of-control government. He came at a time when educators were teaching our youth that America was the enemy. He came at a time when American citizens were being forced to cede our country to unvetted foreign invaders and illegal aliens in exchange for Democrat Party votes. He came at a time when Democrats, celebrities, and the media were shaming gun owners and Christians for their conservative beliefs, and where daring to say  Merry Christmas  was a borderline punishable offense. He gave up a successful business and time spent with his close-knit family to step into a hornet s nest like no one could ever have imagined, but he did it because he believed in the greatness of America, and in defending that greatness, no matter the personal cost. That s what makes his New Years tweet so perfect!President Trump took time tonight, to wish his supporters,  enemies   the very dishonest Fake News Media  and even his  haters  a  Happy and Healthy  2018. As we say goodbye to an incredibly successful 2017, led by an incredibly successful President, we d like to thank President Trump for the incredible sacrifices he s made on behalf of every American (even those who don t yet understand) to Make America Great Again!President Trump tweeted:  As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America! As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017As a special tribute to President Trump, as he wraps up his unbelievably successful first year, we d like to share this powerful article, written by Evan Sayet. The article brilliantly explains why America loves the  fighter  Donald J. Trump. HE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality, and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course, I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

COORDINATED? Yet Another Hack Reporter Claims U.S. Doesn’t Have ‘Moral Authority’ To Talk About Iranian Protests [Video],"A coordinated effort to spew anti-Trump propaganda by reporters from CNN and ABC has us pretty disgusted.

This is a mind blower We just reported that America gives over $24 billion in aid to countries around the world. Iran has been bashing the U.S. for decades and now this liberal hack at CNN says the world thinks we don t have a moral leg to stand on? America has literally been the beacon of light for the world!

The world  might need to do a reality check on this one Via Daily Caller: During CNN s coverage of protests in Iran Saturday, a correspondent read a statement from the Iranian government, adding that many countries are  frustrated  with the United States, and that many think America doesn t have a  moral leg to stand on. CNN correspondent Arwa Damon said,  This coming out from the [Iranian] foreign ministry, not only talking about the fact that they view the government of President Trump as the greatest bearer of ill will towards Iran but going on to say that,  The people of Iran give no value or credibility to such opportunistic expressions by the Government or the person, Mr. Trump. American officials, through their conduct have not earned a place from which they can express masked sentiments as sympathies, for the aware of the people of Iran.

WATCH: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM DROPS BOMBSHELL… FINALLY Confirms The Fake Russian Dossier Was Used To Obtain FISA Warrant To Spy On Trump,"Everyone suspected the sketchy Steele Dossier was what corrupt FBI and DOJ officials used to get the October 2016 FISA warrant against Trump. FBI and DOJ officials refuse to answer that question publicly.Rep Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said in a statement: We now know that the so-called Steele dossier was paid for by the Democratic Party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then-candidate Trump. What the American people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by Steele on the Democrats  dime was used by the Obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against Trump associates. The FBI has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of Congress. The Trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against Trump or his associates. Immediately after his inauguration, President Trump came out swinging over the  fake  Russian dossier. He even went as far as to blame the intelligence community.  President Trump was immediately criticized for his comments, and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory. As it turns out, he wasn t too far off the mark.CT   Despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question, and despite numerous on-camera questions to FBI and DOJ officials about the 2016 FISA process, no-one had definitively confirmed the Christopher Steele  Russian Dossier  was the underlying evidence for the 2016 FISA application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate Donald Trump. UNTIL NOW.Senator Lindsey Graham just confirmed the sketchy Steele Dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the FISA court. Brian Kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious, but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it. Watch at starting at the 04:10 mark: The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone. The back-story contains both the FBI and the DOJ scheme. Expose it, remove it, and the entire  muh Russia conspiracy  collapses under the weight of sunlight This is critical and important because the specific use of the Steele Dossier underpins the BIG UGLY and exposes the entire top-tier apparatus of the FBI Counterintelligence Division (Peter Strzok, Bill Priestap, James Baker, Andrew McCabe) and the DOJ National Security Division (John Carlin, Stuart Evans, Mary McCord and Sally Yates), as well as DOJ Bruce Ohr and FBI lawyer Lisa Page directly to  conspiracy  charges.The 2016 FBI counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the Trump Campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a FISA warrant, sold as a defense of U.S. democracy from Russia, which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etc.The DOJ involvement surrounds legal arguments, processing of FISA applications, and use of the legal system to support the FBI operation with actionable legal framing (against Trump). The DOJ National Security Division carried out that collaboration with the FBI.Tablet Mag did a deep dive into the Fusion-GPS connection to the creation of the Steele Dossier; and more specifically how Fusion-GPS head Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the White House prior to the DOJ and FBI applying for the FISA warrant   SEE HERE.Tablet Mag outlines how Mary Jacoby even bragged about getting the  Russiagate  narrative started:A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele s top-secret  sources  in the Russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire.Understanding the origins of the  Steele dossier  is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States.[ ] In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.)  It s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what Glenn s role was in exposing Putin s control of Donald Trump,  Jacoby wrote.  Let s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn. This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the  Steele dossier,  on which the Russiagate narrative is founded. (read more)The Tablet-Mag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished Steele Dossier entering into the White House and how President Obama likely saw and reviewed the content.However, missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefarious.Remember, previous media reporting -in conjunction with Clinton campaign admissions- have confirmed the DNC and Clinton Campaign financed Fusion-GPS through their lawyers within Perkins Coie. Fusion then hired Nellie Ohr the wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr who thereafter sub-contracted with retired British MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write/research/provide credibility for  the dossier. The dates here are important because they tell a story.The origin of the Clinton effort with Fusion-GPS was April 2016. That s the same month Fusion hired Nellie Ohr, wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr, to gather opposition research on candidate Trump. It would be most likely that Nellie Ohr was in contact with Christopher Steele. DOJ Deputy Attorney Bruce Ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with Christopher Steele and Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson in October 2016; the same month the FISA warrant was granted.However, there was another event in this April 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the Dossier origination. [Hat Tip Katica] Check this out:In April 2016 Mary Jacoby shows up on White House visitor logs meeting with President Obama officials. In April 2016 the Clinton Campaign and DNC hired Fusion-GPS to organize the Russia research, that later became known as the  Steele Dossier .(link to White House Logs)The wife of Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS), Mary B. Jacoby, with years of Russia-angled reporting  including Donald Trump  visits the White House in April 2016, at the same time as the DNC and Clinton hire Fusion GPS to conduct the opposition research on Donald Trump, surrounding Russia?This timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidental.Expand slightly and consider:April: Mary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, visits the White House. The Clinton Campaign and DNC then hire Fusion GPS to conduct  Opposition Research , with a Russian emphasis. Fusion GPS then hires Nellie Ohr who specializes in Russian-centric counterintelligence. Nellie Ohr then contacts MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write a Russian Dossier. A month later, May 2016: Nellie Ohr s husband inside the DOJ, Bruce Ohr, is then working with FBI counterintelligence head Peter Strzok. By June 2016: Peter Strzok, Bruce Ohr, and DOJ Attorney Lisa Page then apply for the first FISA warrant.[June 24th, 2017, Mary Jacoby appears on Facebook taking credit for the origination of the Russiagate narrative.]This timeline is so transparent it s deafening.[More from the Tablet] Simpson and Jacoby had ID d Manafort as a world-class sleazeball and they were right. A slick Georgetown Law grad running in GOP circles since the Reagan campaign, Manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people. I would only add here that, in my personal experience, journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written, especially stories with a character like Manafort at the center.So when the Trump campaign named Paul Manafort as its campaign convention manager on March 28, 2016, you can bet that Simpson and Jacoby s eyes lit up. And as it happened, at the exact same time that Trump hired Manafort, Fusion GPS was in negotiations with Perkins Coie, the law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the Trump campaign they had started for the Washington Free Beacon.

BILL NYE The FAKE Science Guy THREATENS Conservatives…Blue States Will “Impose Economic Sanctions” Against Climate Change Denying States,"Friday on MSNBC, climate activist Bill Nye warned conservatives to  watch out,  saying progressive blue states will  address climate change  on their own.Nye said,  Only 40 percent of people in the U.S. think that Congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups, especially from the fossil fuel industry, have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty, plus or minus two percent, is the same as plus or minus 100 percent. He continued,  There s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writ-large states rights. Just watch out, conservatives, if states rights include California, Illinois, New York   these places that, where people voted in a progressive fashion   watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions, either overtly or by default, on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done. Then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way. He added,  We ve got to remind people that we re all in this together. The people I think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies. We want to engage everybody. Not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest. It is not in the best interest, especially of your children and grandchildren. A couple of times you mentioned that I am against the president and so on. I m not especially against the president. I just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future, to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future. This is true, not just with regard to the national debt, which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved Ronald Reagan, not only will that national debt increase, but the climate debt, in a sense, what we have to do to address climate change, will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down.    Breitbart NewsThe climate change debate went nuclear last year, over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming  pause. In an article on the Climate Etc. blog, John Bates, who retired last year as principal scientist of the National Climatic Data Center, accused the lead author of the 2015 NOAA  pausebuster  report of trying to  discredit  the hiatus through  flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards. In addition, Mr. Bates told the Daily [U.K.] Mail that the report s author, former NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information director Thomas Karl, did so by  insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation. Gradually, in the months after [the report] came out, the evidence kept mounting that Tom Karl constantly had his  thumb on the scale    in the documentation, scientific choices, and release of datasets   in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy,  Mr. Bates said Saturday on Climate Etc.The June 2015 report,  Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus,  which updated the ocean temperature record, was published six months before the U.N. s Paris summit.The accusations sparked a fierce back-and-forth Sunday between so-called climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of Mr. Bates  claim, which he defended on the Climate Etc. blog run by former Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry.Zeke Hausfather, Berkeley Earth climate scientist, said in a Sunday  fact-check  on the CarbonBrief blog that the Karl paper s conclusions  have been validated by independent data from satellites, buoys, and Argo floats and many other independent groups. While NOAA s data management procedures may well need improvement, their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups,  Mr. Hausfather said, citing Berkeley Earth and the U.K. s Met Office Hadley Centre.He said the record  strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. Meanwhile, the whistleblowing prompted a  we-told-you-so  moment from Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee who have long suspected the Obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 1998-2013 pause in global temperature increases. Now that Dr. Bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within NOAA about the quality and transparency of the data before publication, we know why NOAA fought transparency and oversight at every turn,  said Chairman Lamar Smith in a Sunday statement.The panel launched an investigation into the NOAA pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was  rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so-called Clean Power Plan and upcoming Paris climate conference. Dr. Bates  revelations and NOAA s obstruction certainly lend credence to what I ve expected all along   that the Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored NOAA s own standards for scientific study,  Mr. Smith said.Mr. Bates said he decided to come forward after reading a Washington Post article Dec. 13 that said federal scientists are  frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump. As a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data,  he said on Climate Etc.In his experience, the  most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of Tom Karl et al. 2015 (hereafter referred to as the Karl study or K15), purporting to show no  hiatus  in global warming in the 2000s. NOAA did not return immediately Sunday a request for comment. The Daily Mail said that Mr. Karl  admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published  but denied trying to influence the climate summit. Asked why he had not waited, he said:  John Bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time. He denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for Paris, saying:  There was no discussion about Paris,  said the Daily Mail article.The American Geophysical Union issued a statement saying it was  very closely monitoring the situation, have considered the possible implications, and will be sharing any new information or response by AGU with you here.

JUST IN: TRUMP ENDS FREE MONEY TRAIN After Pakistan Refuses To Stop Housing Terrorists…Cuts STUNNING About Of Military Aid ,"The Trump administration on Friday announced the United States will deny Pakistan military aid amounting to $255 million as it expects Islamabad to take decisive action  against terrorists and militants on its soil . The United States does not plan to spend the $255 million in FY 2016 in Foreign Military Financing for Pakistan at this time,  said a spokesperson of the President s National Security Council in a statement to Hindustan Times. The President has made clear that the United States expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil, and that Pakistan s actions in support of the South Asia Strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship, including future security assistance. The Administration continues to review Pakistan s level of cooperation. The statement reflected and sealed the administration s complete disillusionment with Pakistan, which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by President Donald Trump personally and leading members of his cabinet, such as secretaries James Mattis and Rex Tillerson.Financial Times reported last week that  the Trump administration is considering dropping Pakistan as an ally as it examines tough measures to quell more than 20 terrorist groups it says are based in the country.  Here again, the President who is daily derided and ridiculed by foreign policy  experts  is right, and they are wrong: Pakistan is no ally, and has not been for years. This is a rupture that is much needed and long overdue.President Trump has accused the Pakistani government of  housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. And it s true, with the most notorious of these being Osama bin Laden himself. Journalist Carlotta Gall, who reported from Afghanistan for the New York Times for twelve years, reported in March 2014 that:Soon after the Navy SEAL raid on Bin Laden s house, a Pakistani official told me that the United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden s presence in Abbottabad. The information came from a senior United States official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha s or one about him in the days after the raid.  He knew of Osama s whereabouts, yes,  the Pakistani official told me. The official was surprised to learn this and said the Americans were even more so.He shouldn t have been. It had been obvious for years at that point, and remains obvious, that the Pakistanis had been aiding the same jihadists that the U.S. government has been giving them billions of dollars to fight. This could be the severest blow dealt to Islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it,  said a leading US expert on Pakistan, who did not want to be identified.  There is more coming,  the expert added.  IOTWReportThe amount, $255 million, is left over from $1.1 billion aid earmarked for Pakistan in 2016, and which included non-military aid as well. It was cleared for handing over in August, just days before it would lapse as unspent money.First reported by The New York Times, the move to withhold the money, which may not be large but would have signaled US backing, is reported to have come shortly after Pakistan refused to hand over to the Americans an operative of the Haqqani Network apprehended during the rescue of an American-Canadian family in October.The Haqqani Network is an affiliate of Afghan Taliban and works out of Pakistan, inflicting massive casualties on the US-led international coalition in Afghanistan. Frustrated by Islamabad s reluctance to give them, the United States has tied large portions of military aid payments to Pakistan for its actions aimed at debilitating the network.Pakistan, however, has chosen to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in such payments over 2015 and 2016, instead of kicking out the terrorists. And it has lost equity.The Trump administration was clear from the start it wouldn t countenance continuity in ties and aid without real changes.  We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,  President Donald Trump had said unveiling his new South Asia strategy in August.  But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.   Hindustan Times",politics,"Dec 30, 2017"

IT ONLY TOOK ONE TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP For Billionaires To Open Up Their Wallets For This “FIGHTER!”,"A week after President Trump endorsed Ron DeSantis for Florida governor via Twitter, a handful of billionaires have thrown their support behind the three-term Republican congressman, per Politico.Here s President Trump s tweet endorsing Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.  Trump tweeted:  Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER! Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2017Why it matters: The monetary support DeSantis has received could prove instrumental in his race, because, in a  state as big as Florida, where a week s worth of saturation TV during next year s general election could cost as much as $3 million, cash is king,  per Politico.Supporters include casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge fund heiress Rebekah Mercer, investment tycoon Foster Friess, as well as other donors who have funded Trump s 2016 campaign and the conservative Koch brothers  network, per Politico.  AxiosRepresentative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) is a fighter. Here s an example of how DeSantis took on the fake Trump-Russian collusion story:Sun Sentinel   DeSantis, who hasn t officially announced his candidacy, thanked Trump in a press release with the headline,  President Trump Backs Ron DeSantis for Governor of Florida. I m grateful to have the president s support and appreciate what he has done,  DeSantis said, adding praise for Trump achievements that have pleased conservatives: recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, signing the tax reform legislation, and appointing conservative judges.DeSantis, a Republican from Ponte Vedra Beach, has been a strong supporter of Trump.In August, he proposed cutting off funding for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.DeSantis  proposal, which went nowhere, would have stopped money for the investigation 180 days after it becomes law. And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"
WATCH HERO Singlehandedly Shut Down Anti-Trump Protest: “Hey! This is library!” [Video],"The video below is one of the highlights from the protests last year. Protesters at the University of Washington were firmly reminded that their shouting in a library was not appreciated.

AMERICAN WORKERS Scr@wed Over By Outsourcing Jobs Get Their Day In Court,"American workers have suffered tremendously with the outsourcing of jobs to foreign workers. The H-1B Visa program has scr@wed over Americans with decades of experience in jobs. American workers are forced to train their foreign replacements adding insult to injury for the American workers being laid off.Many of the workers are threatened that they will lose their payout if they break a gag order. One of the most famous cases of an employee who didn t take a payout so he could speak up is from a Disney worker. The emotional testimony below is Exhibit One of why this Visa program is so horrible:AMERICAN WORKERS SUE FOREIGN COMPANY: American workers suing an India-based outsourcing firm accused of discriminating against its U.S.-born employees, while favoring Indian nationals, will get their day in court thanks to an Oakland, California federal judge. This week, a California federal judge not only refused to throw out a case against Tata Consulting Services (TCS), one of the largest outsourcers in the U.S. of American jobs, but he also turned the case into a class-action lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.ANTI-AMERICAN BIAS:The case was brought against TCS in 2015 by American workers who said they experienced an anti-American bias at the company, which they say overwhelmingly favors imported workers of Indian descent.Brian Buchanan, one of the American workers suing TCS in the class-action suit, said he had nearly 30 years of experience in the Information Technology (IT) industry when he and roughly 400 American workers were laid off by Southern California Edison after TCS was contracted to outsource the Americans  jobs to cheaper foreign workers.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"
CNN ANCHOR: Fox Does A ‘Disservice’ To Viewers By TELLING THE TRUTH [VIDEO],"CNN s Brian Stelter called out  Fox & Friends  for doing a  disservice to viewers,  but his reasoning may leave you scratching your head . In fact, we re sure it will leave you puzzled.As you probably know, it was reported on Thursday that Trump s approval at the end of his first year in office is on par with Obama s approval rating at the same time during his presidency.Daily Caller reports: Fox & Friends  shared this fact on air Friday morning, leading the president to tweet this out:While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28, 2009, which was 47% and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017Cue Brian Stelter. According to Stelter, it is a  disservice  to make any comparisons of poll numbers that are favorable toward Trump. It is especially bad if Trump signals that he is happy with what has been reported. This is a prime example of how  Fox & Friends  does a disservice to viewers,  Stelter tweeted.This is a prime example of how  Fox & Friends  does a disservice to viewers: https://t.co/ErJBOTAHbo  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 29, 2017Let s review the facts.On Dec. 28, 2009, according to a Rasmussen poll, Obama had a 47 percent approval rating. On Dec. 28, 2017, Trump had a 46 percent approval rating. Obama s approval rating on December 29, 2009   just one day later   was 46 percent, the exact same as Trump s.So Brian Stelter is apparently angry that Fox News reported poll numbers that are factually accurate because they happen to be favorable to the president. Very unbiased.FOX COULD START TELLING LIES LIKE STELTER AND CNN DO ALL THE TIME:Watch this classic moment where The Weather Channel CEO calls  baloney  on the Global Warming claims by Stelter: John Coleman, Founder, The Weather Channel, appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources with host Brian Stelter, after writing an open letter to UCLA denying the existence of anthropogenic global warming. This is a great takedown:Coleman told Stelter that  CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus. Well there is no consensus in science. Science isn t a vote. Science is about facts,  and that he was  terribly disappointed  by his former network, The Weather Channel, because it  has bought into [climate change]. But so has all the media. That s no big surprise. Coleman notes that he is  not a  paid shill  (as has been claimed) of the Koch Brothers,  concluding his letter with a link to Heartland s Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) website. Coleman s open letter to UCLA was sent to numerous local television stations in the Los Angeles area, as well as the Los Angeles Times.Coleman produced a special report for KUSI-TV, entitled Global Warming: The Other Side. The program suggests that Global Warming is a scam and presents what Colemen contends is evidence of a deliberate manipulation of world temperature data by NASA and other groups.",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"

But if the movement that has done such a good job in 2017 at protecting our institutions only protects our institutions, I think they are going to miss an opportunity.

The video below shows just how out of control the left is when it comes to the corruption within the FBI and DOJ.When a Republican lawmaker called for a  purge  of what he said are  deep state  elements within the FBI and Justice Department, the MSNBC host Hallie Jackson was clearly agitated and shocked: I m very concerned that the DOJ and the FBI, whether you call it deep state or what, are off the rails,  Florida Rep. Francis Rooney stated then cited reasons behind his concern. The anti-Trump bias and the demotion of Bruce Ohr were just two of the examples Rooney gave.Jackson shot back,  Congressman, you just called the FBI and the DOJ off the rails. Something that you re okay with talking about here? How does that not sort of undermine the work that the agencies are doing? I don t want to discredit them. I would like to see the directors of those agencies purge it,  said Rooney.  And say look, we ve got a lot of great agents, a lot of great lawyers here, those are the people that I want the American people to see and know the good works being done, not these people who are kind of the deep state. Jackson responded:  Language like that, Congressman, purge? Purge the Department of Justice? Rooney responded,  Well, I think that Mr. Strzok could be purged, sure. Ms. Jackson might want to read up on the corruption that s been uncovered so far with the FBI and DOJ.",politics,"Dec 28, 2017"
WHY THIS Democrat Stronghold County Voted For Trump…And Why They’ll Vote For Him Again: “He’s a fighter…nobody’s gonna push him into a corner” [VIDEO],"AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"
CHAIRMAN OF DEMS FOR TRUMP: My Party is Suffering from ‘Trump Derangement’ [Video],"We have to agree that the left is suffering from Trump derangement because just about anything the POTUS does is met with derision from the Democrats. There is no middle ground but only division that continues with the leaders of the left stirring the pot. Think about it. Without the division, the left has nothing Well, the The chairman of Democrats for Trump reacted to repeated calls for the president s impeachment and obstructionist behavior by members of his party. I think it s Trump derangement,  former New York City Council President Andrew Stein said on  Fox & Friends. Ed Henry played video of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) introducing articles of impeachment and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) telling a crowd that President Trump s motives and actions  are contemptible. Impeach 45 every day,  she later said.Stein said he doesn t know why his fellow Democrats think Trump is a  bad guy. Stein thinks President Trump should just continue to take his message to the people. We have to agree that the president needs to go around the lying media to deliver his message.The latest example of lying from the media is the poor treatment of First Lady Melania Trump. The media bombarded Melania with fake news about a tree that needed to be cut down. The press made it seem like  evil  Melania demanded that the tree be removed. In reality, the 200-year old tree had become a hazard. The media conveniently left that part out.Via Fox News Insider: ",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"
HOUSE INTEL Slaps Subpoenas on McCain Institute Associate Involved in “Trump Dirty Dossier” Sources,"Please see our previous report below on the McCain Institute associate who has now been subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee. David J. Kramer was in hot water before for the same reason the Intel Committee is now issuing a subpoena:He was previously subpoenaed by the lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed. The guy just refuses to give out any information on sources for the  dirty  dossier. This raises the question of if there were sources that were fictional and were used just to build a fake case against Trump. President Trump just tweeted out that the dossier is a  pile of garbage . Could it be that this  pile of garbage  was used to make the case for a FISA warrant to spy on POTUS  The plot thickens on this one The Daily Caller reports: The House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena for an associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain s who revealed last week that he knows the names of the Russian sources used in former British spy Christopher Steele s infamous dossier.A congressional source tells The Daily Caller that California Rep. Devin Nunes issued the subpoena on Wednesday for David J. Kramer, a former State Department official.Kramer refused to divulge the names of Steele s sources during a Dec. 19 interview with the panel, the source says.Steele used Russian sources to gather information on the Trump campaign and Donald Trump s activities in Russia. The ex-spy was working for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was on the payroll of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE MCCAIN ASSOCIATE WHO REFUSED TO SPILL THE BEANS: Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzfeed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

"REMEMBER “Pam” From “The Office”? The Real-Life Actress, Jenna Fischer, Just Got CALLED OUT On Twitter For Using Bad Information To Bash Trump’s Tax Bill","Jenna Fischer is best known for playing the very likeable character,  Pam , in the hit series  The Office . Actress Jenna Fischer decided to use her huge fan base of over 750,000 followers on Twitter to point out how the GOP Tax bill that President Trump worked so hard to push through was punishing teachers. The only problem is, Fischer s tweet was incorrect.Maybe she should stick to comedy.Actress Jenna Fischer, best known for her role as Pam on NBC s  The Office,  found herself in hot water after she shared inaccurate information about the GOP tax bill on Twitter. I can t stop thinking about how school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes something they shouldn t have to pay for with their own money in the first place. I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh,  Fisher tweeted on Saturday.After Fischer got destroyed on Twitter for posting bad information, she DELETED her tweet.Twitter users were quick to point out that Fischer was misinformed; the $250 school supplies deduction was included in the bill.Please don't spread half-truths! Teachers will still have up to a $250 deduction for supplies with the new plan! It's not enough but it is still something.  Matt Campbell (@mcampbell77) December 23, 2017The 43-year-old followed up her tweet writing,  It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn t have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers. It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers  Jenna Fischer (@jennafischer) December 24, 2017However, the actress was still incorrect and the Twitterverse was more than happy to correct her.

Nothing changed.  Jason Ensley (@JasonKensley) December 24, 2017To her credit, Fischer admitted she was wrong and even made a formal apology on Twitter for posting information that was not accurate about the GOP tax bill.Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250.

SAY WHAT? PROSECUTORS Claim Convicted ISLAMIC TERRORIST Used His LAPTOP and Jihadi Materials To Radicalize Fellow Prisoners In NY Prison,"According to The Sun, George W. Bush  successor, Barack Obama, promised to close the camp in 2009, calling it a  sad chapter in American history .But he faced strong opposition from Congress and succeeded only in reducing the number of inmates from 245 to around 40, as detainees were either freed or transferred to other countries.Since his election in 2016, Donald Trump has vowed to keep the prison open and use it to detain  bad dudes .He has also stated he would happily use torture against inmates.He said:  I would bring back waterboarding, and I d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding  Don t tell me it doesn t work torture works  if it doesn t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they re doing to us. We have to fight fire with fire. According to CNN, the man convicted in the 2016 bombing in New York s Chelsea neighborhood that injured 30 people has been trying to radicalize other inmates, federal prosecutors say.Ahmad Khan Rahimi also told a judge he is on a hunger strike.Rahimi provided inmates with copies of terrorist propaganda and jihadist materials, including speeches by Osama Bin Laden and the late militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, bomb-making instructions, books on jihad and issues of the al Qaeda-backed magazine Inspire, prosecutors said.Rahimi  has been attempting to radicalize fellow inmates in the Metropolitan Correction Center by, among other things, distributing propaganda and publications issued by terrorist organizations,  according to a letter from Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim to US District Judge Richard Berman.Rahimi let other inmates view the items on his laptop and gave them electronic copies, Kim s letter said. Discs of the materials were found in two inmates  possession.Defense attorneys for Rahimi have yet to respond to the allegations.Prosecutors said Rahimi began distributing these materials in October if not earlier. Rahimi was convicted October 16 on eight federal charges in connection with the Chelsea bombing.Among the inmates Rahimi gave the materials to, prosecutors say, is Sajmir Alimehmeti, who is scheduled to go on trial next month on terrorism-related charges.Rahimi was arrested and charged after a pressure cooker bomb went off in New York s Chelsea neighborhood on September 17, 2016. A second pressure cooker bomb was found a few blocks away, on 27th Street, but didn t detonate.Earlier the same day, a bomb went off near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey.After a two-week trial and roughly four hours of jury deliberation, Rahimi was convicted of charges including the use and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a public place, destroying property by means of fire or explosives, and using a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence   including DNA and fingerprints   linking Rahimi to the bombs that were placed in New Jersey and New York.Rahimi faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, according to an earlier statement from Kim.Rahimi faces separate charges in other jurisdictions in connection with the bomb that went off in Seaside Park, a backpack containing improvised explosive devices found the following day at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and a shootout he had with police before being taken into custody.",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"
ISRAEL WILL NAME New Train Station Near Western Wall After President Donald Trump,"Israel s transportation minister is pushing ahead with a plan to extend Jerusalem s soon-to-open high-speed rail line to the Western Wall, where he wants to name a future station after President Donald Trump. The Western Wall is the holiest place for the Jewish people, and I decided to name the train station that leads to it after president Trump   following his historic and brave decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel,  Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz told the Jerusalem Post.The national daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth was first to report Tuesday that Katz had approved final construction plans for the train, which will include excavating a 2-mile tunnel from the Umma (nation) station at the entrance to the city to the Cardo in the Jewish Quarter.The route will take travelers through downtown Jerusalem and under the politically and historically sensitive Old City. The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray.Transportation Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadia said Wednesday the project is estimated to cost more than $700 million and, if approved, would take four years to complete.Katz s office said in a statement that the minister advanced the plan in a recent meeting with Israel Railways executives, and has fast-tracked it in the planning committees.Katz said a high-speed rail station would allow visitors to reach  the beating heart of the Jewish people   the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. Donald Trump: It s time to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital.Trump s announcement acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel s capital   and his pledge to move America s embassy there   enraged Palestinians and much of the Muslim world.The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution last week rejecting the U.S. s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital, with several traditional American allies voting in favor of the motion.The Western Wall train proposal will likely face opposition from the international community, which doesn t recognize Israeli sovereignty over east Jerusalem and the Old City, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed. ThePalestinians seek east Jerusalem and the Old City, home to Muslim, Christian and Jewish holy sites, as capital of a future state.  Daily Mail ",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"

But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry.

She takes advantage of federal travel perks to book multiple flights (only to cancel at the last minute and at no charge). She demands an upgrade to premier seats. She expects, in her words,  to be treated like a queen. Sometimes it gets ugly. For instance, when one peasant of a flight attendant failed to serve the food Jackson Lee requested, the congresswoman went wild.  Don t you know who I am?  she reportedly shrieked.  I m Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Where is my seafood meal? I know it was ordered! That inflight incident was in 1998, and Jackson Lee has only increased in seniority since. She sits on the Committee on Homeland Security and she serves as the ranking member of the subcommittee on transportation security, no doubt, giving her, even more, sway over the airlines and even more of a reason to feel entitled.When accused of taking an ill-gotten first-class seat, Jackson Lee was adamant she didn t do anything wrong. It s just the way she expects to be treated.  I asked for nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary and received nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary,  the congresswoman said in a statement.

WHY FINAL “Sunday Night Football” Game Was Canceled… Is Low Attendance The Reason?,"The NFL announced Tuesday that the final  Sunday Night Football  game of the season has been canceled Was it due to low attendance in previous weeks? Well, it s part of the reason. Low attendance has been plaguing the league since the kneeling controversy took hold.Recently, a liberal news source tried to downplay the boycott from NFL fans by citing injuries from key star athletes in the NFL as the reason for low interest in games.  We think the kneeling controversy has more to do with the lack of interest in games. It s being reported that the attendance is down 9% from last year:We ve seen stadiums with hundreds of empty seats along with low viewership.There are a few other reasons why the game was canceled but low attendance was certainly part of it:Daily Caller reports:The league had yet to announce who would play during the primetime game next Sunday, but with the chance that none of the matchups would have playoff implications for one or both of the teams, they opted not to schedule the game.NEW YEAR S EVE:The other problem the league faced was broadcasting a game on New Year s Eve, which would invite lower number of viewers traditionally on that night. We felt that both from a competitive standpoint and from a fan perspective, the most fair thing to do is to schedule all Week 17 games in either the 1 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. windows,  NFL broadcast chief Howard Katz said in a statement.The last time a  Sunday Night Football  game took place on the final night of the year was in 2006 when the Chicago Bears hosted the Green Bay Packers. That game was Hall of Fame member Brett Favre s final game with the Packers. Despite that fact, the game only drew 13.4 million viewers, which for that season was a quarter of the typical audience for  SNF. In a season plagued with lower ratings due to the national anthem protests, the league s decision was not surprising.",politics,"Dec 26, 2017"
FLASHBACK: CNN HOST Concerned Working Americans “Are Going To Vote For Donald Trump Again” After Getting Bonuses and Pay Raises,"CNN s Allyson Camerota expressed her concern about how the tax breaks for Americans will harm the Democrats chances of winning in the mid-term elections with Michigan s Democrat Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.Camerota appeared somewhat panicked, as she started out her segment whining to Dingell about bonuses and pay raises that Americans will receive as a result of Trump s GOP tax bill:  Just, ever since the tax reform was announced, or the tax overhaul, or whatever you want to call it, there have been this whole slew of companies that have come forward and saying,  Guess what? We re going to give out bonuses, now, to our employees.  I mean, I have just a partial list in front of me, and there s nine companies on here from AT&T, to Boeing, to Comcast, Bank of America, Sinclair, Wells Fargo, PNC. There s all sorts of companies that say they re going to give something to a thousand dollars worth of bonuses to their hundreds of thousands of employees. Fifth Bank Corp is gonna boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Obviously, they could have done this before the tax overhaul was announced. They were sitting on profits. But they didn t, they did it when the tax overhaul was announced. And I m wondering if you, as a Democrat are you worried about the wind in their sails? People vote with their pocketbooks. I don t have to tell you this. So if you get a thousand dollar bonus, you re voting for Donald Trump again. Although Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) voted against the tax cut bill, she smartly responded to Camerota s question by saying that she s  never going to complain that any working man or woman will get an extra boost in their, uh, income.  Dingell then told Camerota that at some point a lot of people are still going to see a tax increase at some point. Camerota interrupted her to say,  Years from now Years from now! Well after the mid-terms. So couldn t this carry Republicans through the mid-terms?

MEDIA IGNORES TRUMP’S FIRST Record-Breaking Christmas Season…Retail Sales Of $600 BILLION: “This is literally the best season since before the recession”,"The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017CBS News reported on the retailer s record-breaking holiday season without ever mentioning President Trump:Total retail sales this holiday season added up to a record $598 billion dollars   up $33 billion from last year.Not surprisingly, the AP also failed to mention President Trump: Experts have issued rosy forecasts for the season. Shoppers seemed to be in the mood with unemployment at a 17-year low and consumer sentiment at its highest level since 2000. Shoppers have been spending at a pace not seen since the Great Recession, says Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners. The Wall Street Journal reported sales were up for retailers like Macy s and Wal-Mart. The Wall Street Journal even mentioned that spending was up in all income categories, as shoppers were encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, but failed to attribute any of the retailer s success to President mention Trump:Retailers are enjoying some extra Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%. Overall, this year was a big win for retail,  Ms. Quinlan said.That newfound buoyancy is a relief to retailers from department-store giants like Macy s Inc. to mall favorites like Gap Inc. that struggled through a difficult year of store closures, declining foot traffic and bankruptcies by chains including the Sports Authority, Toys  R  Us and Payless Shoes.Investors, who have abandoned many retail stocks even as the broader stock market surged, have started to return. Shares of Macy s and Gap, for example, have jumped 24% and 18%, respectively, in the past month, compared with a 3% gain in the S&P 500. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has rallied 40% on the year and, like online nemesis Amazon.com Inc., is trading near all-time highs. Unlike in past years, when spending was driven by high-income shoppers, this holiday season a broader swath of the population opened their wallets, encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, analysts and economists said. Fewer people are living paycheck to paycheck,  said Chris Christopher, executive director of economic-research firm IHS Markit.  There is a lot more spending from the lower- and middle-income groups, while the upper-income groups are splurging. Fox Business News reported the amazing Christmas season sales, but neglected to mention President Trump s positive effect on the economy:Retailers are finally enjoying some Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%. It started with a bang in the week leading up to Black Friday,  said Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president of marketing insights at Mastercard. She added that retailers benefited this year from Christmas Day falling on a Monday, giving shoppers a full weekend to scoop up last-minute purchases. Dec. 23 ranked next to Black Friday in terms of spending, according to Mastercard.Via: Gateway Pundit",politics,"Dec 26, 2017"

He began by quoting Nelson Mandela, whom he noted rebelled against his government for its systemic oppression.The Mandela quote: It is never my custom to use words lightly. If 27 years in prison have done anything to us, it was to use the silence of solitude to make us understand how precious words are and how real speech is in its impact on the way people live and die. Harlan connected the power of words especially as it pertains to Gods word to their ability to educate, enlighten and draw out the best in people, while he also cautioned words can be used to cause harm.Your words can have as much destructive potential as they do healing, Harlan said. Gods word is pure light.A crowd of people encircled the president to shake his hand when it came time for the peace-be-with-yous.

Once it cut back, the president was standing in his pew, and appeared to be holding the communion, which he then took.Songs:* God rest ye merry gentlemen * O come let us adore him ",politics,"Dec 25, 2017"

While there are a few openly conservative actors in Hollywood, the majority of them are swimming in a cesspool of liberalism and are consumed with hate for President Trump and his deplorable supporters.  From George Clooney trashing Trump over his stance on refugees coming to America from Muslim hotbed nations, to Meryl Streep using a televised award ceremony to trash our newly inaugurated President, to has-been pop stars like Madonna saying she d like to blow up the White House; America has had it up to their eyeballs with people who are some of America s top earners, thanks to the support of people they openly mock for supporting President Trump.  The LA Times reports, that Hollywood is celebrating the end of 2017 with astronomical sales from  Star Wars: The Last Jedi,  which is on track to soon exceed $1 billion in global ticket sales and eventually become the biggest movie of the year. But that won t be enough to write a happy storyline for the industry.Although movie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to dip just below last year s record of $11.38 billion, the number of tickets sold is projected to drop 4% to 1.26 billion   the lowest level since 1995, according to preliminary estimates from studio executives.The falloff in ticket sales can mostly be explained by a handful of movies that flopped, especially during the dreary summer season that posted the worst results in more than two decades. Even such massive hits as  Wonder Woman,   Thor: Ragnarok  and  It  couldn t make up for a lackluster summer lineup populated by rickety franchises ( Alien: Covenant ) and poorly reviewed retreads ( The Mummy ).However, the long-term decline in attendance reflects systemic challenges facing the industry. Audiences are spending less time going to the movies and are consuming more entertainment on small screens and through streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon that are spending billions on original video content.Sorry to burst your liberal bubble, but now that the curtain has been pulled back, the deplorable crowd isn t interested in supporting hate-filled, liberal Hollywood.

PRESIDENT TRUMP Calls Out Corrupt FBI Clinton Crony for Alleged ‘Misuse’ of FBI Email,"You just can t make this level of cronyism up. It s a blatant disregard for laws, rules and just about everything else unethical. But this is the Clintons so the rules don t apply to them. They are sickeningly corrupt grifters who have been able to get away with just about everything for decades. It s time to call them out and hold them accountable for their lawlessness. The American people need to be able to trust their government will follow the rule of law. The time is now President Trump tweeted out to call out the FBI s Andrew McCabe on his cronyism with the Clintons and misuse of FBI email:President Trump tweeted Sunday that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe allegedly used his official agency email account to  promote  his wife s failed 2015 attempt to win, as a Democrat, a Virginia state Senate seat..@FoxNews-FBI s Andrew McCabe,  in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2017 The president has long been a critic of the FBI s cronyism with the Clintons. Our previous report on what went on when Andrew McCabe s wife ran for Virginia state senate is unbelievably corrupt:OUR REPORT ON THE CLINTON CRONY BACK IN OCTOBER SPELLS OUT THE CORRUPTION:How much more criminal activity are American voters willing to overlook? Have we, as Americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by Hillary or anyone attached to Hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation? Are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in America? The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.The FBI said in a statement that during his wife s campaign Mr. McCabe  played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton s emails. FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said. Once I decided to run,  Dr. McCabe said,  my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate. Mr. McCabe is a longtime FBI official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live with their children.The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe s first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe s failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons  political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. For entire story: WSJ",politics,"Dec 24, 2017"
WHY OBAMA’S CORRUPT INNER CIRCLE Is Desperately Fighting To Protect His Failed Reputation," History shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea. Those words were written by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Thursday in the New York Times, in arguing for appeasement towards Kim Jong-un.It was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with Barack Obama s feckless foreign policy   and it explains why the world that President Donald Trump inherited is so dangerous and unstable.The Obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the U.S. could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone.  BreitbartNoah Rothman of Commentary Magazine wrote a brilliant article about the  death rattle of Obama s reputation . In his article, Rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former President Barack Obama took our nation down, and why the successes of President Trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against Trump in defense of Obama s failed legacy.The members of Barack Obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual. Former CIA Director John Brennan accused Donald Trump and his administration of engaging in  outrageous,   narcissistic  behavior typical of  vengeful autocrats  by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the United States in the United Nations, as though that were unprecedented. It is not. James Clapper, Obama s director of national intelligence, all but alleged that the president is a Russian  asset.  Perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former Democratic president s foreign-policy professionals were placed in the New York Times by Obama s national security advisor, Susan Rice. In her estimation, America has abdicated its role as a  force for good. Rice s attacks on the Republican administration deserve the most attention, if only because they are the most apoplectic. Donald Trump s recently released national-security review paints a  dark,   almost dystopian  vision of the world, Rice contended. His world is full of  hostile states and lurking threats.  Rice claimed that there is  no common good  in Trump s worldview. What s more, there is no  international community  and no  universal values.  There are just  American values. Rice acknowledges that Moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace,  Western values,  and U.S. sovereignty. She implies that Trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that. In fact, it was Obama much more so than Trump who has failed to see the obvious.Barack Obama was inarguably the least Atlanticist president since the end of World War II. Within a year of Russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, Obama scrapped George W. Bush-era agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to Central Europe. In 2013, the last of America s armored combat units left Europe, ending a 69-year footprint on the Continent. By 2014, there were just two U.S. Army brigades stationed in Europe. The folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader since Stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring Ukraine.A year later, Putin intervened militarily in Syria, where U.S. forces were already operating, resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the Cold War. Putin s move in Syria should not have come as a surprise; Barack Obama outsourced the resolution of the Syrian conflict to Moscow in 2013, if only to avoid making good on his self-set  red line  for intervention in that conflict despite the norm-shattering use of WMDs on civilians. Even Rice s chief complaint about Trump, his failure to condemn Putin s brazen intervention in the 2016 election, didn t elicit a reaction from Barack Obama until the final month of his presidency.By contrast, and to the surprise of just about everyone, the Trump administration has been tough on Russia. Trump has ordered harsh sanctions on Moscow s Iranian allies for violating United Nations resolutions a course the Obama administration declined to take even if it allowed Hezbollah terrorists with direct links to Putin to operate with impunity. He ordered long overdue airstrikes on Putin s vassal regime in Syria, halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process. Trump not only declined to lift Obama-era sanctions on Moscow, as many feared he would, but expanded them. This administration closed Russian consulates and annexes in the United States. It has targeted Putin allies like Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov under the Magnitsky Act the same act that Kremlin cutout Natalia Veselnitskaya lobbied the Trump campaign to scuttle. Trump has even gone so far as to open U.S. arms sales to Ukraine, representing a significant blow to Putin s ambitions in Europe. It is without a doubt that Trump now has a stronger record on Russia than Barack Obama ever did. No wonder Susan Rice is so angry.Rice further alleged that Trump recklessly accused China of being an  avowed opponent  of the U.S. rather than just a competitor, and then insisted that China has not  illegally occupied its neighbors.  Tell that to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, or Taiwan, each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the South China Sea that the People s Republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases. Rice suggested that Trump s  realists  decided to  lump  Beijing in with Moscow, not because it is a rising military and economic power, but because they wanted to  placate  American nationalists. Though this White House declined to defibrillate the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse, it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with Beijing to isolate Pyongyang than Obama did. As the North Korean nuclear crisis intensifies, China has backed fresh sanctions on North Korean financial institutions, cut off all access to Chinese iron, lead, and coal, and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the Stalinist state by as much as 90 percent. And all in the space of one year.Rice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the U.S. should labor: LGBT people, people in poverty, people with AIDS, people under 30, et cetera. Rather, the document insists that all mankind, regardless of conditions or accidents of birth, are objects of U.S. interest. Rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security. Good. Climate change is not itself a threat to American national security but a threat multiplier, as the weather has always been. Save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of U.S. free-trade obligations, Rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante. In nearly all respects, it was Obama s White House, not Trump s, that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the U.S. and the world less safe as a result.Even as early as March of 2017, it was clear that the Obama administration s foreign-policy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of American interests abroad. They had every reason to be. For now, at least, the Trump administration has declined to govern as Trump campaigned; not as a populist firebrand but a conventional Republican. Susan Rice and her former White House colleagues have every reason to worry, but not for the United States. Their reputations, however, are another matter entirely.To read the entire article, click here. ",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017President Trump then tweeted:FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017Judicial Watch today released 79 pages of Justice Department documents concerning ethics issues related to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s involvement with his wife s political campaign. The documents include an email showing Mrs. McCabe was recruited for a Virginia state senate race in February 2015 by then-Virginia Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam s office.The news that Clinton used a private email server broke five days later, on March 2, 2015. Five days after that, former Clinton Foundation board member and Democrat party fundraiser, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, met with the McCabes. She announced her candidacy on March 12. Soon afterward, Clinton/McAuliffe-aligned political groups donated nearly $700,000 (40% of the campaign s total funds) to McCabe s wife for her campaign.Judicial Watch obtained the documents through a July 24, 2017, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to respond to an October 24, 2016, FOIA request (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:17-cv-01494)). Judicial Watch seeks:All records of communication between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and other FBI or Department of Justice officials regarding ethical issues concerning the involvement of Andrew McCabe and/or his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, in political campaigns; All records related to ethical guidance concerning political activities provided to Deputy Director McCabe by FBI and/or DOJ officials or elements.Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton tweeted about McCabe using his FBI email account to promote his wife s campaign that was  funded with Clinton crony cash . Fitton then suggested that McCabe is  retiring  after he was also implicated in the FBI anti-Trump texts, saying:  No wonder he s  retiring ..@JudicialWatch uncovered docs suggesting FBI #2 Andrew McCabe used his FBI email account to promote his wife's campaign (funded with Clinton crony cash). He was also implicated in the FBI anti-@RealDonaldTrump texts. No wonder he's ""retiring."" https://t.co/BCEaX1mFQ8  Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) December 23, 2017An October 23, 2016, email shows McCabe running the response effort to a Wall Street Journal article that was published that day, titled  Clinton Ally Aided Campaign of FBI Official s Wife.  McCabe provides Michael Kortan, the assistant director of Public Affairs, his version of a timeline of events surrounding the Clinton investigation and his wife s campaign. McCabe said he contacted then-FBI Chief of Staff Chuck Roseburg about Jill McCabe s candidacy and was told that  the D [Comey] has no issue with it.  (Judicial Watch earlier this month released documents showing that McCabe finally did recuse himself from the Clinton investigation only a week before last year s presidential election.)Internally, the Wall Street Journal article started a flurry of emails among Mrs. McCabe s campaign, Kortan, Director McCabe, and the FBI s General Counsel. Part of that exchange is an email from McCabe to someone in the General Counsel s Office:  Sucks pretty much. Buckle in. It s going to get rough.  The colleague responds,  I know. It s awful. I shouldn t be shocked by now, but I really am appalled.  McCabe also forwarded the article to Comey who responded,  Copy. On October 24, 2016, a memo was sent to all Special Agents in Charge, Assistant Directors, Executive Directors and the General Counsel s Office regarding the Wall Street Journal article discussing campaign activities concerning Mrs. McCabe. Kortan suggested that questions could be referred to his office and he attached an  Overview of Deputy Director McCabe s Recusal Related To Dr. McCabe s Campaign for Political Office.  The Overview itself was previously reported by Judicial Watch.The documents also show repeated use of the official FBI email system in connection with Mrs. McCabe s political campaign. For example:On March 13, 2015, Mrs. McCabe emails to her husband s official FBI email account a draft press release announcing her run for state Senate.In August 2015, McCabe uses his official FBI email account to advise a redacted recipient to visit his wife s campaign website:  Jill has been busy as hell since she decided to run for VA state senate (long story). Check her out on Facebook as Dr. Jill McCabe for Senate. On November 2, 2015, Mrs. McCabe forwards an email to her husband   then the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI s Washington Office   that accuses her opponent of extorting local businessmen. The email was sent to her husband s official FBI account.The documents include an October 2016 letter from House Government Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to McCabe questioning a possible conflict of interest by noting that Clinton headlined a Virginia fundraiser on June 26, 2015, for Mrs. McCabe.  A significant amount was donated after the FBI had initiated its investigation and begun meeting with Secretary Clinton s attorneys in August 2015. The documents also show that FBI leadership was sensitive to reports of FBI internal dissent with then-Director Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation. On October 24, 2016, Mrs. McCabe forwarded to Director McCabe a True Pundit article titled,  FBI Director Lobbied Against Criminal Charges For Hillary After Clinton Insider Paid His Wife $700,00.  The story reported that former FBI Executive Assistant Director John Giacalone resigned in the middle of the Clinton email investigation because he saw it going  sideways  and that Jill McCabe received money from a PAC headed by McAuliffe, who was under investigation by the FBI for campaign finance law violations. McCabe forwarded the article to Comey, noting  FYI. Heavyweight source.  Comey replied to McCabe, copying Chief of Staff James Rybicki, saying,  This still reads to me like someone not involved in the investigation at all, maybe somebody who heard rumors  These new documents show that the FBI leadership was politicized and compromised in its handling of the Clinton email investigation,  said Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch President.  It well past time for a do-over on the Clinton emails that requires a new, honest criminal investigation of her misconduct. The Senate Judiciary Committee and the U.S. Special Counsel have opened investigations into whether McCabe violated the Hatch Act and failed to properly disclose payments to his wife s campaign on his ethics report. The Justice Department s Inspector General is examining McCabe for failing to recuse himself from the Clinton investigation due to his meeting with McAuliffe.",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
MARINE CORPS GENERAL WARNS U.S. TROOPS: “There’s A War Coming”,"While the mainstream media remains transfixed on a phony Trump-Russian collusion story, they completely ignore the real news, about how things appear to be heating up between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S.A Marine Corps commandant on Thursday warned U.S. troops stationed in Norway to be prepared for a coming war.Neller pointed to the near future possibility of Russia and the Pacific theater being the next major areas of conflict.Sgt. Maj. Ronald Green sounded a similar tone. Just remember why you re here,  Green said.  They re watching. Just like you watch them, they watch you. We ve got 300 Marines up here; we could go from 300 to 3,000 overnight. We could raise the bar. The warnings came a day before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told troops at Fort Bragg, N.C., that  storm clouds are gathering  over the Korean Peninsula.Whether the comments were more than motivational rhetoric remained unclear.Neller and Green s arrival in Norway coincided with heightened tensions between the U.S. and its NATO allies and Russia. According to Military.com, Russia warned Norway that its decision to host a new unit of U.S. troops through the end of 2018 would negatively affect relations. FOX NewsAccording to UK Express, Russian President Putin said the US missile defense sites in Romania containing interceptor missiles could also house ground-to-ground intermediate-range cruise missiles, which would be in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.He told the military officials that both the US and NATO have been  accelerating build-up of infrastructure in Europe  and emphasised that the deployment of NATO forces near Russia s borders had threatened its security.He said:  When we move military units on our own territory, they present it as some kind of a threat. And when they move military bases, infrastructure and new weapons near our borders they present it as something normal. It s probably normal for those who do it, but not for us. NATO has deployed military units to Poland and the Baltics to reassure allies worried over Russia s intentions following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimea and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.Mr Putin mentioned NATO s US-led missile defense system and efforts to develop new prospective conventional weapons among other security challenges.He added:  They are searching for some violations on our part while consistently infringing on it themselves. All that seriously affects security in Europe and in the whole world. Mr Putin accused the US of violating a landmark Cold War-era nuclear arms pact and harbouring aggressive intentions, and pledged to fend off any potential threats.FOX News  At a Q&A session with the troops in the Norwegian Home Guard base near Trondheim, Neller said that the U.S. could shift its focus from the Middle East to Eastern Europe, citing Russia s conflicts with Ukraine and Georgia as justification. He told the Marines that they should be prepared for a  big-ass fight  on the horizon.Russia has reportedly been uneasy about the presence of American troops close to its borders. The 300 U.S. Marines deployed to Norway in June 2016 were the first foreign troops allowed to operate in the country since World War II.In September of this year, Russia conducted a joint-military exercise with neighboring Belarus that involved 12,700 troops.A new National Security Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday singled out Russia and China as two world powers challenging  American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.

"A YOUNG DONALD J TRUMP: The 34-Year Old Shares His Views on Politics, Leadership, and a Vision for America’s Renewal in 1980 [Video]","The video below is a much watch! A young Donald J. Trump speaks about leadership and politics long before he ran for president. His insight and thoughtfulness are there in a more soft spoken manner than today. Enjoy!Below this video is commentary from the interviewer many years later.INTERVIEWER RONA BARRETT 40 YEARS LATER:Many people may not remember but nearly 40 years ago then-businessman and developer Donald Trump was questioned about whether he would want to be President of the United States someday.His answer then might surprise you now.NewsChannel 3 sat down with world renown journalist and former gossip columnist Rona Barrett, who honed her journalist craft interviewing the rich and famous from the late 1950s to the early 1990s.Barrett reflected back on 1980. She had just launched a pilot program, zeroing-in on America s self-made millionaires. Her first guest was developer Donald Trump. He had a very spicy reputation way back in the 70s,  Barrett said.  He was flamboyant, in that the press made him that kind of a guy. If I look back now, He was very much like he is today. By then, Trump was on his way to becoming a billionaire. He was 34 years old. He was one of the first people, if not the first person, who ever bought the air over a major facility in Manhattan,  Barrett said.  I think it was Bonwit Teller (a luxury department store) at the time. He bought the air to build something above the place he couldn t buy! I had never heard of anyone buying air! It was Trump s first network interview. And it was done in his opulent, 66-floor penthouse. Gold in certain places, real gold in certain places,  Barrett remembered.  I mean, this fellow knew how to live a very rich life. KEYT s Beth Farnsworth sat with Barrett in the lobby of the Golden Inn and Village senior community she built in the Santa Ynez Valley. She looked back at the man she interviewed, for two hours, all those years ago. He was charming,  Barrett said.Then, she reflected on the man leading our country today. I didn t see any of the bravado that I see now. That 1980 interview between Barrett and Trump is now in demand, worldwide, all because of that one question. It just popped out of my mouth. Would you like to be President of the United States? He looked at me and he said,  No . The clip reveals a few of the reasons Trump did not embrace a presidency at the time. I see it as being a mean life and I also see it as somebody with strong views and somebody with the kind of views that are maybe a little bit unpopular, which might be right,  Trump said. And he made some sort of comment about he didn t like the attitude of political people, having to smile and be with babies,  Barrett added.At the time, Trump said he didn t feel America was  going forward  in a  proper direction  and was using very little of its  potential  as a nation. It should really be a country that gets the respect of other countries,  Trump told Barrett.He was highly critical of the handling of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. He also said,  There are many more people who are far more qualified to be President than I am .  Barrett remembered.Yet, he refused to name names. The one man could turn this country around,  Trump said during the interview.  The one proper President could turn this country around. Barrett did some more reflecting during NewsChannel 3 s interview, then offered a personal opinion while admitting that she s no doctor or expert. I ve always had another feeling after that interview with Donald as I was talking to him,  Barrett reflected.  I always have felt that he was trying to prove to daddy that he could be bigger and better than daddy ever could. Fred Trump was a highly successful real estate developer, mostly in New York City, and a philanthropist; but he was never President of the United States.Barrett said she was surprised when the elder Trump s son, Donald, announced his bid to run. I didn t think of him as presidential,  Barrett said.Today, Barrett stops short when it comes to labeling Donald Trump as a  good  or  bad  President. I d rather not comment. I m not a political person. I m just another human being,  Barrett said.Read more: keyt",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
"BREAKING: FBI ARREST STOPS Horrific San Francisco “MASS CASUALTY” Christmas Day Attack By MUSLIM, Truck Driver and Former Marine Sharpshooter","Truck attacks are becoming increasingly popular with Muslim extremists as a way to threaten large groups of people in popular areas. Meanwhile, the US Appeals Court has just ruled President Trump s travel ban violates federal law and goes beyond  the scope of his delegated authority. The ban, which targets people from six Muslim-majority countries, should not be applied to people with strong US connections, the court said.Breitbart News   The FBI announced on Friday that it arrested California tow truck driver Everitt Aaron Jameson for plotting a Christmas terror attack on Pier 39 in San Francisco.In statements to undercover informants, Jameson outlined a plan that would have involved running civilians down with his truck, deploying improvised explosives, and using his skills as a Marine sharpshooter to increase the body count. A note he evidently intended for publication after the attack swore allegiance to ISIS and cited President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as a reason for his actions.FBI documents state that Jameson planned to use his tow truck for a mass-casualty attack on Pier 39 because he  had been there before and knew it was a heavily crowded area.  He reportedly said Christmas would be  the perfect day to commit the attack. I m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back. Allahu Akbar! The kuffar deserve everything and more [for] the lives they have taken,  he allegedly told an FBI informant after the November 2 truck jihad attack in New York City, which killed eight people. Allahu akbar! It says he was one of us. May Allah grant him Jannah firtuidus Amin,  he said of New York City truck terrorist Sayfullo Saipov, indicating that he hoped Saipov would enter paradise as a reward for attacking the infidels.Jameson also reportedly spoke approvingly of the attack on a Christmas party by a husband-and-wife jihadi team in San Bernardino in December 2015 and suggested his operation would include vehicles, explosives, and firearms. He told an undercover agent that America  needed another attack like New York or San Bernardino. Communicating with FBI assets he believed were representatives of the Islamic State, Jameson advertised himself as a military veteran and offered to put his skills at the service of the caliphate. In a meeting with undercover informants, he added that he was  well versed  in the Anarchist Cookbook, a manual for making bombs and other implements of terrorism. He also offered financial assistance to ISIS, offered to travel to Syria if needed, and said he was ready to die for  the cause.  He demonstrated fluency in spoken Arabic during a telephone call. I was a soldier in the kuffar army before I reverted,  he said.  I have been trained in combat and things of war. Inshallah, anything of that nature, as well as funding. Anything for Allah. The FBI confirmed that Jameson attended U.S. Marine Corps basic training and earned a  sharpshooter  rifle qualification. He was eventually discharged for  fraudulent enlistment,  apparently because he failed to disclose a history of asthma to the recruiters.When the undercover FBI operatives asked what he needed for the attack, Jameson outlined an ambitious plan involving M-16 and/or AK-47 rifles, timers, remote detonators, and pipe bomb materials.When a search warrant was executed at Jameson s residence in Modesto, a number of pistols, rifles, and ammunition were confiscated, along with his last will and testament and a handwritten letter he signed as  Abdallah abu Everitt ibn Gordon al-Amriki.  The letter was evidently meant to be published after he carried out his terror attack. It reads:I, Abdallah adu Everitt ibn Gordon, have committed these acts upon the Kuffar, in the name of Dar al Islam, Allahu Akbar! You all have brought this upon yourselves. There is no innocent Kuffar! Each and every Kuffar in this Nationalistic, Godless society has a hand in this. You ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews. Both You and he are wrong, it belongs to the Muslemeen. We have penetrated and infiltrated your disgusting country. These Acts will continue until the Lions of Islam overtake you. Turn to Allah, make tawbah and fight with us, the soldiers who fight in the day and the night. Allah SWT is most forgiving. I am not. Long live Isil, Long Live Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

JUST IN: SUSPECTED LEAKER and “Close Confidant” of James Comey Has Been Reassigned From His Post As TOP FBI Lawyer [VIDEO],"On December 5, 2017, Circa s Sara Carter warned there would be a major shake-up at the FBI after the Inspector General s report was completed. So far, Sara Carter has been right on everything she s reported on, as it relates to the Mueller investigation. In the video below, Carter tells Sean Hannity why she believes the FBI will have a major shake-up soon there are 27 leakers that the IG is looking at! Yes, 27 leakers!Sara Carter: We re going to see parts of that report before December (end of the month). We re going to see other parts of his report coming out after January. And they re looking at Peter Strzok. They re looking at Comey. They re looking at 27 leakers. It would not surprise me if there was a shake-up at the FBI and a housecleaning.Watch:Is the FBI s former top attorney, James Baker, one of the first  leaker  casualties?  James Baker, the FBI s leading lawyer who was a confidante of fired FBI Director James Comey, has been reassigned from his post, as the agency s top personnel are under high scrutiny.Baker told colleagues he will assume different duties for the bureau, the Washington Post reported.Baker oversees the bureau s Office of General Counsel and has received such awards as the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in counter-terrorism in 2006.He also was the subject of a leak investigation over the summer after Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a crackdown on leakers.The FBI had no comment when asked why Baker was being reassigned and what he would be doing.His reassignment comes at a time of increased scrutiny and pressure on the agency, following the release of private text messages between agents working in the Hillary Clinton email probe.   Daily Mail Three sources, with knowledge of the investigation, told Circa that Baker is the top suspect in an ongoing leak investigation, but Circa has not been able to confirm the details of what national security information or material was allegedly leaked.A federal law enforcement official with knowledge of ongoing internal investigations in the bureau told Circa,  the bureau is scouring for leakers and there s been a lot of investigations. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to contain leaks both within the White House and within its own national security apparatus.Baker is a close confidant of former FBI Director James Comey, and recent media reports suggested he was reportedly advising the then-FBI director on legal matters following private meetings the former director had in February with President Trump in the Oval Office.Baker was appointed to the FBI s general counsel by Comey in 2014 and has had a long and distinguished history within the intelligence community.",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
TRUMP RUFFLES FEATHERS With New And Bold Presidential “Challenge” Coin,"Who knew that members of a presidential administration can have coins made to hand out.  Challenge coins  are given out and received by different people like first responders or the military . President Trump has the challenge coins he has received displayed in the Oval Office.Coin collector John Wertman shows his  very gold  Trump challenge coin:HOW THEY GOT THEIR START:Challenge coins got their start as military baubles bearing division insignia and presented by officers to troops for exemplary service. The moniker came from a tradition in which service members challenged one another to produce their coins. Those who did not have one had to buy a round of drinks.For two decades, the commander in chief has doled out distinguished-looking coins as personal mementos. Now, the presidential  challenge coin  has undergone a Trumpian transformation.The presidential seal has been replaced by an eagle bearing President Trump s signature. The eagle s head faces right, not left, as on the seal. The 13 arrows representing the original states have disappeared. And the national motto,  E pluribus unum    a Latin phrase that means  Out of many, one    is gone.Instead, both sides of the coin feature Trump s official campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. The aide said the president, whose real estate properties are known for their gilded displays of wealth and status, was personally involved in redesigning the coin. Trump, who also had a hand in creating his famous red campaign hat,  wanted to weigh in on it,  the aide said.  It s beautifully made. FEATHERS RUFFLED: Ethics experts  are all aflutter because President Trump used his political slogan on the coin: For the commander in chief to give a political token with a campaign slogan on it to military officers would violate the important principle of separating the military from politics, as well as diminishing the tradition of the coin. There is also dispute about who pays for the coins. As it turns out, the Republican Party is paying for the coins.Yes, the coin is very gold and big but it is Trump s style. It s interesting to note the coins of Obama and Trump reflect each president.Read more: Boston Globe",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"

BIG MOUTH ROSIE O’DONNELL Could Be Heading To Prison After Taking Her Hate For President Trump Too Far,"Many are suggesting that the former comedian, turned militant, leftist activist, Rosie O Donnell needs to be treated by federal authorities like every other American when it comes to being held accountable for her actions. O Donnell broke the law when she offered to pay two Republican lawmakers for voting against Trump s tax cut bill on Twitter. Even offering this is illegal. You are not above the law but I guess you are since the Feds haven't been knocking on your door. with all these tweets you obviously are not joking.  Androgynous Priest (@AndrogynPriest) December 21, 2017After ex-comedian Rosie O Donnell s meltdown on Twitter before the Senate s big tax vote Tuesday night, President Donald Trump can reasonably direct federal authorities to lock her up   and even to  take some money out of her fat-ass pockets,  which he once infamously cited as a personal goal.Starting a few hours before the legislation passed, O Donnell tweeted:so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flakeif they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million casheach  ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20, 2017Even after another Twitter user, Louise Mensch, replied that O Donnell was irresponsibly advocating bribery, O Donnell doubled down.i disagree it is obvious there is a price corker had one collins tooflake almost brave he crawled out backwards2 million to any GOP senator who votes noon KILLING AMERICANS MILLIONS WITH OUT HEALTH CARE MY GOD HAVE WE NO SO  ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20, 2017Federal law addresses O Donnell s actions.18 U.S. Code   201 criminalizes the attempted bribery of federal officials by whoever  directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official   with intent to influence any official act. The penalty? For Rosie, she could spend up to 15 years in jail, suffer a lifetime ban from elective office and pay up to a cool $12 million:The statute calls for a fine of  not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. In court, O Donnell would probably argue that her attempted bribe was in jest, or perhaps a syndrome of a mental illness.After all, her attorneys would argue, who, while seriously attempting to bribe members of the U.S. Congress would do so in such a reckless, public manner that would all but ensure a conviction?

OOPS! Emails Prove Woman Who Accused Trump Of Sexual Assault In The 1990’s Is A Phony…Tried to Get A Job On Trump’s Campaign That Would Require Her To Be Close To Him,"Just a few months before reports of her sexual assault lawsuit against Donald Trump rocked the campaign, cosmetics executive Jill Harth lobbied to be the then-candidate s make-up artist.On Monday, The Hill detailed the story of Harth s repeated efforts to become Trump s campaign makeup artist and to pitch her new male cosmetics product line,  Made Man.  Her solicitations, in both emails and in person, came a few months before her 1997 lawsuit was brought to light, along with several other sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate. The Hill learned of her appeals to Trump in an interview with Harth in December about her friendship with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom; Trump s lawyers then provided the emails. The Hill followed up with Harth, who defended both her attempts to work with the man she accused of sexual assault and her current call for him to be impeached.In 1997, Harth sued Trump for allegedly pushing her up against a wall and trying to get his hands up her dress during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in 1993. She eventually withdrew the lawsuit as part of a settlement over Trump allegedly pulling out of a business deal. But as The Hill notes, the tone of her emails to Trump in 2015 was  starkly different  than the tone of her 1997 lawsuit and the interviews she gave about it in 2016.The Hill provides some examples of the emails Harth personally sent to Trump between the summer of 2015 and early 2016: Hi Donald, you are doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States. I am definitely on Team Trump as so many others are,  Jill Harth wrote the future president in an Oct. 1, 2015, email sent to him through his New York company s headquarters. I can t watch television without seeing you or hearing your name everywhere! It s a good thing for sure but PLEASE let me do your makeup for a television interview, a debate, a photo session, anything!  Harth wrote. It kills me to see you looking too orange and with white circles under the eyes. I will get your skin looking smoother and even toned,  she added, boasting she would  sculpt your face  to look good on high-definition television sets.The Hill also notes that Harth is one of the accusers who financially benefited from her work with Bloom on the allegations: the attorney set up a GoFundMe page for Harth that paid off her mortgage and an email revealed that Harth s sales soared after Bloom appeared on TV to discuss her allegations.  Daily WireBIG PAYDAYS FOR TRUMP ACCUSERS:According to FOX News, Legal powerhouse Lisa Bloom tried to line up big paydays for women who were willing to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct during the final months of last year s election, according to an explosive report.Proud to call Attorney @LisaBloom my friend. She is very warm, smart, caring, & REAL. Watch her interview on  The View . You ll see what I mean. She even mentions me. pic.twitter.com/rAW9CvxGYn  Jill Harth (@jillharth) November 11, 2017The Hill reported Friday that Bloom worked with campaign donors and tabloid media outlets to arrange compensation for the alleged victims and a commission for herself, offering to sell their stories. In one case, Bloom reportedly arranged for a donor to pay off one Trump accuser s mortgage and attempted to score a six-figure payment for another woman. The former ultimately declined to come forward after being offered $750,000, the clients told The Hill. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"

“NUMEROUS” CONFLICTING STATEMENTS: Deputy FBI Director in Hot Water After Testimony [Video]," While we re really not surprised by the  conflicting  statements by Andrew McCabe, we just can t believe another type of conflict wasn t an issue long ago. He took hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from the Clintons for his wife s campaign. It doesn t take a rocket scientist to understand that this is a conflict of interest and wrong on every level. Please see our previous report below on McCabe s involvement in his wife s run for Virginia state senate in 2015.FOX News reports:Congressional investigators tell Fox News that Tuesday s seven-hour interrogation of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe contained numerous conflicts with the testimony of previous witnesses, prompting the Republican majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee to decide to issue fresh subpoenas next week on Justice Department and FBI personnel.Investigators say McCabe recounted to the panel how hard the FBI had worked to verify the contents of the anti-Trump  dossier  and stood by its credibility. But when pressed to identify what in the salacious document the bureau had actually corroborated, the sources said, McCabe cited only the fact that Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had traveled to Moscow. Beyond that, investigators said, McCabe could not even say that the bureau had verified the dossier s allegations about the specific meetings Page supposedly held in Moscow.The sources said that when asked when he learned that the dossier had been funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, McCabe claimed he could not recall   despite the reported existence of documents with McCabe s own signature on them establishing his knowledge of the dossier s financing and provenance.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifies behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. pic.twitter.com/GHjihJkmz4  FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 19, 2017OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON MCCABE:Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Counsel violating the Hatch Act according to a new report by Circa News.The Hatch Act prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races. Photos of McCabe campaigning for his wife raised questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Special Counsel for violating The Hatch Act that prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.The Office of U.S. Special Counsel, the government s main whistleblower agency, is investigating whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s activities supporting his wife Jill s Democratic campaign for Virginia state senate in 2015 violated the Hatch Act s prohibition against FBI agents campaigning in partisan races.The agency s probe was prompted by a complaint in April from a former FBI agent who forwarded social media photos showing McCabe wearing a T-shirt supporting his wife s campaign during a public event and then posting a photo on social media urging voters to join him in voting for his wife. I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,  McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election, in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her, according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother, wearing an FBI shirt, and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director, #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9, 2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

An ethics expert told Circa the photos raised legitimate questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Meanwhile, Virginia Gov.

“PROGRESSIVE” DE BLASIO VISITS IOWA: Denies He’s Running For President…So He Just Wanted To Visit Iowa?,"Soooo, NYC Mayor de Blasio wants you to believe he just wants to visit Iowa. He s been running for President since before he became Mayor, that s why he ran for Mayor. And even in progressive NYC, everyone still despises him for doing nothing. And yes, he s further left than Hillary and Obama.Via Free Beacon: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D.) on Tuesday repeatedly denied that he is running for president in 2020 during a trip to Iowa, a state that automatically begs questions about White House ambitions if politicians head there. No,  de Blasio said.  I m not running for president. The New York Times noted, however, that de Blasio made Iowa his first stop since his easy re-election to the mayorship. The Iowa caucuses launch the nominating process each presidential election cycle, so any jaunts to the midwestern state attract attention.The Washington Post described the far-left mayor as fielding versions of the 2020 question throughout the day. He described himself as focused on his second term.De Blasio is a total phony HERE S A PREVIOUS REPORT ON DE BLASIO S  PROGRESSIVE  AGENDA:Why would anyone expect anything else from a mayor who criticized Barack Obama for being  too conservative  and  too afraid to take the bold kind of action that President Roosevelt took  during the Great Depression. Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a 13-point national  Progressive Agenda  that is being touted as the liberal  Contract with America. The aim is for the  Progressive Agenda  to become the basis for the Democratic Party s main economic policies, including those of its 2016 presidential candidate.De Blasio has compared his plan to the  Contract with America,  a document released by the Republican Party during the 1994 congressional election and drawn up by future House Speaker Newt Gingrich to serve as the GOP policy agenda.Now WND documents that most of the 13 points in de Blasio s  Progressive Agenda  can also be found in the manifestos and literature of the Communist Party USA and the Socialist Party USA.The full progressive plan, entitled,  The Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality,  can be found on the agenda s new website.Here is a comparison of the Agenda s plan with literature from the manifestos and writings of the Community Party USA, or CPUSA, and the Socialist Party USA, or SPUSA.  Progressive Agenda:  Raise the federal minimum wage, so that it reaches $15/hour, while indexing it to inflation. SPUSA:  We call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour, indexed to the cost of living. CPUSA: Calls for  struggles for peace, equality for the racially and nationally oppressed, equality for women job creation programs, increased minimum wage.   Even with ultra-right control of the Federal government, peoples legislative victories, such as increasing the minimum wage, can be won on an issue-by-issue basis locally, statewide, and even nationally.  Progressive Agenda:  Pass comprehensive immigration reform to grow the economy and protect against exploitation of low-wage workers. SPUSA:  We defend the rights of all immigrants to education, health care, and full civil and legal rights and call for an unconditional amnesty program for all undocumented people. We oppose the imposition of any fees on those receiving amnesty. We call for full citizenship rights upon demonstrating residency for six months. CPUSA: Declares the  struggle for immigrant rights is a key component of the struggle for working class unity in our country today.  Progressive Agenda:  Make Pre-K, after-school programs and childcare universal. SPUSA:  We support public child care starting from infancy, and public education starting at age three, with caregivers and teachers of young children receiving training, wages, and benefits comparable to that of teachers at every other level of the educational system.  Progressive Agenda:  Earned Income Tax Credit.   Implement the  Buffett Rule  so millionaires pay their fair share. SPUSA:  We call for a steeply graduated income tax and a steeply graduated estate tax.  CPUSA:  No taxes for workers and low and middle income people; progressive taxation of the wealthy and private corporations.  Dems hail  beginning of revolution De Blasio criticized Obama as  too conservative  to assert a progressive economic vision and  too afraid to take the bold kind of action that President Roosevelt took  during the Great Depression, reported the liberal news network.Speaking at the  Progressive Agenda  launch event outside the Capitol building last Tuesday, de Blasio said  something is changing in America. It s time to take that energy and crystallize it into an agenda that will make a difference,  he said.  We ll be calling on leaders and candidates to address these issues, to stiffen their backbones, to be clear and to champion these progressive policies. Read more at WND ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"

WISCONSIN PRIEST COMES OUT AS “GAY” During Sunday Mass…Gets Standing Ovation…Wait…What?,"In 1992, the Vatican under Pope John Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which stated, among many other things, that  homosexual tendencies  are  objectively disordered.  One of the principal theologians who shaped the document was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would succeed John Paul II as Pope Benedict XVI. He too would take a hard-line stance against homosexuality.Two decades later, Pope Francis has signaled what many believe to be a softening on the matter.In 2013, when asked about gay priests, he famously replied,  Who am I to judge?  He has continued to call for the Catholic Church to treat LGBT people with dignity and respect, and to fight discrimination against sexual minorities.  RNSFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel   The Rev. Gregory Greiten told his congregation Sunday,  I am Greg. I am a Roman Catholic priest. And, yes, I am gay! The priest in the Milwaukee Archdiocese serves as the pastor of St. Bernadette Parish. On Monday, he came out to the rest of the world with a column in the National Catholic Reporter. He received a standing ovation from his parishioners when he made his announcement before the column s publication.Greiten said he was breaking the silence of gay men in the clergy so he could reclaim his own voice.While it is established that there are gay men who serve as priests, it is rare for a priest to come out to his congregation in this way. Greiten shares an estimate in his article that there are between 8,554 and 21,571 gay Catholic priests in the United States from  The Changing Face of the Priesthood.  Church theology teaches that acting upon homosexuality is a sin.In announcing his identity as a gay man, Greiten chastised the Catholic Church for its stance on homosexuality.He wrote: By choosing to enforce silence, the institutional church pretends that gay priests and religious do not really exist. Because of this, there are no authentic role models of healthy, well-balanced, gay, celibate priests to be an example for those, young and old, who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation. This only perpetuates the toxic shaming and systemic secrecy. NYP-Greiten wrote that has decided to stand with the  few courageous priests who have taken the risk to come out of the shadows and have chosen to live in truth and authenticity. The church s silent stance on gay priests perpetuates toxic shaming and systematic secrecy, Greiten wrote. The church needs healthy role models for priests who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation, he said.Greiten met with Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki before coming out, according to an archdiocese spokeswoman. We support Father Greiten in his own personal journey and telling his story of coming to understand and live with his sexual orientation,  Listecki said in a statement Monday.  As the Church teaches, those with same-sex attraction must be treated with understanding and compassion. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"
LEBRON JAMES Brags About Being “Well-Spoken”…Proceeds To Use Vocabulary Of A 4-Yr-Old To Trash President Trump,"Is anyone else sick and tired of overpaid athletes who can t even formulate a proper sentence, criticizing President Donald J. Trump, one of the most successful businessmen of our time?After taking a stand for harmony and togetherness by wearing black sneaker and white sneakers with the word  Equality  written on them, to a game in Washington, DC, on Sunday night, NBA star LeBron James took a decidedly less conciliatory tone, in his post-game comments about President Trump.James said,  Obviously I ve been very outspoken and well-spoken about the situation that s going on at the helm here, and we re not going to let one person dictate us, us as Americans, how beautiful and how powerful we are as a people. It certainly was nice of James to add that he s been  well-spoken,  in addition to being outspoken.The three-time NBA champ and future Hall of Famer continued,  No matter the skin color, no matter the race, no matter who you are, I think we all have to understand that having equal rights and being able to stand for something and speak for something and keeping the conversation going. James did not elaborate on what rights he felt were in danger, nor did he explain exactly what  the conversation  was, or where it was going.However, James did speak from a place of unrivaled authority on the subject of being outspoken. In many ways, James has been the anti-Jordan, whereas MJ avoided political entanglements whenever possible, at least since 2012, James has embraced them whenever and wherever possible.James appeared in a photo with his teammates wearing hoodies in honor of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager shot to death by George Zimmerman in 2012. James wore an  I Can t Breathe  t-shirt to warm-ups at Madison Square Garden to show support for Eric Garner, a New York man who died after an altercation with police in 2014.The 13-time All-Star has also held nothing back when it comes to President Trump.

FORMER DNC AIDES In Hot Water Over Possible Money Laundering Scheme to Fund Terrorism Overseas,"The plot thickens with the saga of the IT workers who worked for Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  They had access to congressional emails and were quite shady. They made millions just disappear. Is this a case of money laundering to fund terrorism?The Daily Caller s Luke Rosiak described it best with this tweet: Need to take $100k in Hezbollah-linked cash while you can read intelligence committee members  emails, as their IT guy? Set up a used car dealership with fake staff, launder it from Iraq thru realtors commissions, and lie about it on House disclosures. Daily Caller reports:The used car dealership known as CIA never seemed like an ordinary car dealership, with inventory, staff and expenses.On its Facebook page, CIA s  staff  were fake personalities such as  James Falls O Brien,  whose photo was taken from a hairstyle model catalog, and  Jade Julia,  whose image came from a web page called  Beautiful Girls Wallpaper. If a customer showed up looking to buy a car from Cars International A, often referred to as CIA, Abid Awan   who was managing partner of the dealership while also earning $160,000 handling IT for House Democrats   would frequently simply go across the street to longstanding dealership called AAA Motors and get one. If AAA borrows a car to Cars International and they have a customer, it was simply take the car across the street and sell it, and then later on give the profit back or not,  Nasir Khattak, who ran the longstanding AAA dealership, testified in a lawsuit.  There was no documentation which is write every transaction that takes place.   If you go and try to dissect, you will not be able to make any sense out of them because there were many, dozens and dozens, of cars transferred between the two dealerships and between other people. Khattak did not explain why he would ruin his existing business to help the Awans.  All of those transactions was to support Cars International A from AAA Motors,  he testified.  That s why I did not make any money from my dealership because my resources were supporting Cars International A. He said only Imran Awan knew what became of the money.  It was Imram, [Abid] Awan s brother, who was running the business in full control,  he said.Imran Awan and his family members were congressional IT aides who investigators said made unauthorized access to the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. At the same time as they worked for and could read all the emails of members of the House intelligence, homeland security and foreign affairs committees, they also ran a car dealership that took money from a Hezbollah-linked fugitive and whose financial books were indecipherable and business patterns bizarre, according to testimony in court records.While Imran and Abid Awan ran their car dealership in Falls Church, Va. in the early part of the decade, Drug Enforcement Agency officials a few miles away in Chantilly were learning that the Iranian-linked terrorist group frequently deployed used car dealerships in the US to launder money and fund terrorism, according to an explosive new Politico expose.The money that disappeared between the Awans  dealership, some $7 million in congressional pay, the equipment suspected of disappearing from Congress under their watch, and their other side businesses   all while they displayed few signs of wealth and frequently haggled in court over small amounts of money   raise questions about whether the Awans might have been laundering money or sending it to a third party.",politics,"Dec 19, 2017"

Eventually, Palin left the house and was handcuffed.He told cops that had told his father to shoot him several times, according to the documents.  NYP",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"
WATCH SWAMP MONSTER James Clapper Make False Claim That Trump is an “Intelligence Asset” for Putin [Video],"Watch some fake news from a swamp creature who should be in jail:Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper referred to President Donald Trump on Monday as an intelligence  asset  for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The term  asset  refers to people with countries or organizations being spied upon who serve as resources for outside spies.Clapper appeared on CNN to discuss Trump s national security strategy speech given Monday, where he referred to Russia as a rival but also said he wanted to form a partnership.The two leaders have also expressed recent gratitude to each other, with Putin calling and thanking Trump for sharing intelligence that helped foil a terror plot and Trump thanking Putin for his recent praise of the American economy.IS THIS GUY KIDDING:This is on the same day that we learn the following about the Obama administration:The Obama administration intentionally derailed investigations into the terrorist group Hezbollah s drug trafficking operation to secure the Iran nuclear deal, according to a new bombshell report.Politico spoke with several members of Project Cassandra, a joint effort between the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Pentagon that was founded in 2008 under the Bush administration to identify and prosecute a drug trafficking, money laundering, and smuggling operation run by the Iranian-backed militants.Over the next eight years, agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations, and informants to map Hezbollah s illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies.They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United States. They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to Africa. And with the help of some key cooperating witnesses, the agents traced the conspiracy, they believed, to the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.Read more: WFB",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"
TRUMP’S NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH Reveals Policy Based on 4 Principles Focusing on ‘America First’,"President Trump delivered a speech on national security that ll knock your socks off. He plans on putting America first: America is in the game and America is going to win.  His strategy involves four basic principles: protecting the homeland by restricting immigration, pressuring trading partners, building up the military and otherwise increasing U.S. influence globally.What s not to love about that? MAGA!Via Fox News: President Trump on Monday unveiled a national security strategy that enshrines his  America First  approach into U.S. policy, stressing American strength and economic security and putting rivals like China and Russia on notice. America is in the game and America is going to win,  Trump said, making clear that the United States will stand up for itself even if that means acting unilaterally or alienating others on issues such as trade, climate change and immigration.In a 20-minute speech, Trump said the U.S. faces  an extraordinarily dangerous world  and one of his goals is to make sure the U.S. is  leading again on the world stage. America is coming back, and America is coming back strong,  he said.Trump, who released his 68-page national security strategy ahead of his speech, said he is making good on campaign pledges that he promised would  revitalize the American economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty and advance our values. Trump s national security strategy, a document mandated by Congress, is based on four principles: protecting the homeland by restricting immigration, pressuring trading partners, building up the military and otherwise increasing U.S. influence globally.Trump also took on the rise in North Korea s nuclear aggression and painted China and Russia as U.S. rivals despite his own relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which included two telephone calls last week.Bryan Llenas has the rogue regime s reaction.  China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity,  the strategy document says.  They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence. The strategy accuses the two nations of  developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture. While Trump in his address did not mention Russia meddling in U.S. elections, the written strategy also calls out Moscow for  using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies  and says adversaries like Russia  target media, political processes, financial networks and personal data. In a shift from the last administration, Trump s strategy also refers to the  jihadist  terror threat and  Islamist  terror groups. We will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders,  it says.Further, the strategy backs off naming climate change as a major threat. The last such strategy document, prepared by then-President Barack Obama in 2015, declared climate change an  urgent and growing threat to our national security. ",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"

YOU’LL NEVER GUESS Who The New York Times Is Blaming For North Korea’s Decades-Long Famine,"After North Korea s most recent missile launch, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un claimed he had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.  US Defense Secretary James Mattis claimed that North Korea now has the ability to hit  everywhere in the world. Meanwhile, the New York Times is blaming the Trump administration for starving the North Koreans, after placing stricter sanctions on the rogue nation.The left-leaning New York Times bizarrely claimed this week that the decades-long famine plaguing North Korea is not the fault of its brutal communist regime, but most likely due to American interference and foreign policy, saying the  hunger is devastating. And it s our fault. The article, published over the weekend, lays the blame of millions of starved and tortured North Koreans at the feet of the American administration, saying the US and its allies have  crippled  Kim Jong Un s ability to feed his own people. Led by the United States, the international community is crippling North Korea s economy,  writes the author.  In August and September, the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions banning exports of coal, iron, lead, seafood and textiles and limiting the import of crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United States, Japan and South Korea have each imposed bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang to further isolate the country. We are trying to inflict pain on the North Korean regime to stop the development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That s understandable. But in the process, we are also punishing the most vulnerable citizens and shackling the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to them,  the author adds.North Korea s massive food shortages date back to the 1990s when dictator Kim Jong Il s regime was incapable of handling droughts and other natural disasters that cut dwindling food supplies by over 30%.

JUST IN: OBAMA REGIME Demanded Homeland Security Officials Stop Using “Sharia” and “Jihadist” Language…Look Who Just Changed That Language [VIDEO],"President Trump addressed the America people today, as he outlined a new and bold national security strategy. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. And On November 8th, 2016, you voted to Make America Great Again. You embraced new leadership, and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope, that is why we are here today. But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Legal Insurrection reports- The White House has unveiled President Donald Trump s national security strategy. It has four main points: Protect America, promote our prosperity, preserve peace through strength, and advance our influence.But one of the biggest points is the return of using  jihadist  and  Sharia,  language President Barack Obama s administration tried to avoid.From Fox News: The primary transnational threats Americans face are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations,  the document states, according to excerpts released ahead of the speech.A search of the document shows the word jihadist appears 24 times in the 68 page document. Obama s 2015 national security strategy mentioned Islam twice.The document mentions that America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Trump listed the ways to do this: disrupt terror plots, take direct actions, eliminate terrorist safe havens, sever sources of strength, share responsibility, and combat radicalization & recruitment in communities.David Reaboi at Security Studies Group noted another massive change:Here is my favorite part of the National Security Strategy and it s MASSIVE Admin acknowledges Sharia is goal and driving force behind Islamist terror groups. Obama effectively banned use of any of this terminology. pic.twitter.com/2HVHhnVqjX  David Reaboi (@davereaboi) December 18, 2017He is correct. Back in January 2016, Homeland Security released a report that called for officials to stop using jihad and sharia. The Washington Free Beacon reported at the time:Under the section on terminology, the report calls for rejecting use of an  us versus them  mentality by shunning Islamic language in  Countering Violent Extremism  programs, or CVE, the Obama administration s euphemism that seeks to avoid references to Islam.Under a section on recommended actions on terminology, the report says DHS should  reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English. Government agencies should employ  American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like  jihad,   sharia,   takfir  or  umma,  states the June 2016 report by the Council s countering violent extremism subcommittee. The DHS report stated that to avoid a confrontational  us versus them  stance in public efforts to counter Islamic radicalization, government programs should use the term  American Muslim  instead of  Muslim American. The Obama administration insisted on this even though ISIS made it NO secret that they wanted the world to live under Sharia law. The terrorist group even formed an all female brigade to help enforce Sharia law through brutal and violent means. ",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"
Over Half Of The 23 NFL Players Still Kneeling During The National Anthem Are From One Team,"Are you one bit surprised by the fact that the one team still doing the most kneeling during the national anthem is the Seattle Seahawks? Seattle happens to be home to many, many social justice warriors so this protest is perfect for the city of Seattle.Daily Caller reports: The national anthem protest has mostly subsided 15 weeks into the NFL season, and the players on just one team outnumber those around the rest of the league who are continuing to kneel.Twelve players on the Seattle Seahawks knelt for the national anthem ahead of their game against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.

JUST IN: Obama Regime Helped Terror Group #Hezbollah Traffic Drugs In U.S “So The Iran Nuke Deal Would Go Ahead”…Proceeds Were Allegedly Used To Design New IED’s That Killed US Troops In Iraq,"This could be one of the largest scandals of our time.  Meanwhile, back in Washington it s all about Trump and Russia, Russia, Russia.The Obama administration has been accused of sabotaging an operation to stop Hezbollah smuggling drugs into the US so that the nuclear deal with Iran could proceed.In a stunning expos  by Politico, the former US President s officials are said to have opened the door for trafficking and money laundering operations by the terror group founded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.The nuclear deal agreed to scrap crippling economic sanctions on Iran in return for a promise from to Tehran to stop nuclear development. By putting themselves between the DEA and Hezbollah, the Obama administration helped the militant group grow into a global security threat that is suspected of designing IEDs used to kill American troops, the report said. Donald Trump s White House slapped at his predecessor Sunday night, with press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeting that the story shows a contrast of  President Trump s success against ISIS vs. President Obama s appeasement of terrorists. And a Republican House leadership aide told DailyMail.com on Monday that the Obama White House  was the worst of the worst when it came to fighting terrorism in the ways that mattered most. The Drug Enforcement Administration led a complex venture called Project Cassandra to tackle the criminality of the Lebanese militant group from 2008 on.But it is claimed Obama s people threw down a number of roadblocks, effectively paving the way for Hezbollah s illegal activities including cocaine smuggling into the US which agents believe raked in $1 billion for the terror group. DEA agents claim the Obama administration stopped them arresting key figures linked to Hezbollah as an agreement on the Iran nuclear deal approached   and scrapped Project Cassandra entirely once the terms were agreed in 2015. Hezbollah s $1 billion-a-year international criminal operation. International drug smuggling operation founded by the mastermind of the bombing of Beirut bombing that killed 241 US Marines in 1983.The organization is now expected to be working with the Zetas cartel to smuggle tonnes of cocaine into the United States One of the world s top cocaine traffickers called  The Ghost  is a Hezbollah operative.Same man accused of selling chemical weapons to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.Hezbollah launders its drugs profits by allegedly shipping used cars from America to Africa and selling them.Money laundering also takes place through South America, the Middle East, and the US.Lebanese arms dealer Ali Fayad is a suspected top Hezbollah operative, according to Politico, and is believed to report to Vladimir Putin.Fayad is accused of plotting the murder of American government workers.Venezuela s vice president Tareck El Aissami is believed to be deeply involved in cocaine trafficking and is an ally of Hezbollah.Hezbollah is believed to be providing weapons and training to anti-American Shiite militias.An alleged Hezbollah drugs kingpin is based in Colombia and is accused of working with the Zetas cartel to smuggle cocaine into the US.Proceeds from the operations were allegedly used to design new IEDs that killed US troops in IraqThe nuclear deal agreed to scrap crippling economic sanctions on Iran in return for a promise from to Tehran to stop nuclear development.By putting themselves between the DEA and Hezbollah, the Obama administration helped the militant group grow into a global security threat that is suspected of designing IEDs used to kill American troops, the report said.David Asher, who helped establish Project Cassandra, told Politico:  This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision.  They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down. He added that the closer Obama came to finalizing the Iran nuclear deal, the more difficult the DEA s job became.The weapons agreement was announced in January 2016, which coincided with Project Cassandra officials being moved on to other assignments.

"HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? LATINO IMMIGRANT, ANTI-TRUMP Activist Group With Ties To George Soros and ACORN Awarded More Than $25 MILLION In Taxpayer Funds","The fact that it has taken so long to uncover massive taxpayer funds being used to directly target our President and one of two major political parties in America should frighten ever taxpaying American.WFB   A liberal activist group that has been involved in direct action campaigns against President Donald Trump and Republicans was recently awarded $400,000 more in taxpayer-backed government grants, records show.Make the Road New York (MRNY), a New York City-based Latino immigrant group with nearly 20,000 dues-paying members, is closely linked to an $80 million dollar anti-Trump network and an approved funding group of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive liberal donor network.MRNY has already hauled in millions of dollars in government grants. Between 2002 and 2014, the group was the recipient of more than $20 million in grants, the Washington Free Beacon previously reported. The amount that they received in 2015 and 2016 are not fully known, given the group s most recently available tax form is from 2014.According to USASpending, a site that tracks federal government grants, MRNY was given $725,000 in grants in 2015 and more than $4.4 million in 2016. However, figures on the site show only a fraction of the total amount in government grants the group has received in previous years as marked on their tax forms.On August 10, MRNY was awarded another grant totaling $420,000 from the Department of Education, records show.MRNY was behind the widely covered protests at the JFK airport following Trump s initial travel ban. The protests, which were billed as spontaneous at the time, were later found to be in the works since one day after the presidential election.The group was involved in the #DeleteUber campaign after Uber allowed drivers to pick up passengers from the airport during the protests. Travis Kalanick, Uber s founder, stepped down from Trump s advisory council following the activist campaign.MRNY was also a part of the #GrabYourWallet campaign, which targeted retailers that sold Trump family products. Nordstrom dropped Ivanka Trump products following the campaign, but cited declining sales as the reason why it had made the decision.MRNY has  partnered  with the Center for Popular Democracy, a New York-based liberal nonprofit that contains old chapters of the controversial and now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), on a  Corporate Backers of Hate  campaign that targeted companies the group s claimed could profit from Trump s policies.The Center for Popular Democracy refers to MRNY as its  sister  organization in the biography of Ana Maria Archila, one of its co-executive directors, on its website. The two groups have swapped a number of individuals throughout recent years. Archila was the co-executive director of MRNY prior to her current position.Andrew Friedman, the other co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, founded MRNY in 1997 and spent years building up the organization before moving to the Center for Popular Democracy. Friedman also sits on the board of directors of MRNY.Javier Valdes, the co-executive director of MRNY, sits on the board of directors of the Center for Popular Democracy.The groups have additionally transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to each other. In 2013, MRNY passed $122,112 to the Center for Popular Democracy. In 2014, MRNY gave the group $25,000, according to tax forms.The Center for Popular Democracy sent $253,900 to MRNY in 2013 with another $100,000 going to its action fund. The Center for Popular Democracy then sent $286,042 to MRNY in 2015.The Center for Popular Democracy s action fund is also spearheading a massive $80 million dollar anti-Trump network that will span across 32 states with 48 local partners.Members of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive network of deep-pocketed liberal donors that was co-founded by billionaire George Soros, are recommended to donate to the Center for Popular Democracy, which receives generous funding from Soros.

JUST IN: Fusion GPS Sued By 3 Billionaires Over Their “Defamation” In War Against Trump,"ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES:Three Russian billionaires are hitting back after they say they were defamed by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Russians  lawsuit says the dossier s assertions  falsely accuse  the three and Alfa  of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election.  It says Fusion recklessly spread the charges to journalists.FUSION GPS FEELS THE KARMA:Fusion GPS, the producer of the infamous fake Trump dossier, is fending off in court three of Russia s richest oligarchs by painting them as corrupt bankers in bed with President Vladimir Putin.The three primary investors in Moscow s Alfa Bank   Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan   filed a libel lawsuit against Fusion in October. Fusion s dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, says two of them engineered cash bribes to Mr. Putin. The dossier also implies that the bank colluded with Mr. Putin to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic Party computers.The lawsuit describes the three billionaires as international businessmen who became  collateral damage  in Fusion s war to destroy the Donald Trump campaign. This is a defamation case brought by three international businessmen who were defamed in widely disseminated political research reports commissioned by political opponents of candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election cycle,  says a Dec. 12 filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The reports are gravely damaging in that, directly or by implication, they falsely accuse the plaintiffs   and Alfa, a consortium in which the plaintiffs are investors   of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election,  says the complaint by the New York law firm Carter Ledyard & Milburn.Fusion responded in court by relying on Wikipedia and its press citations to paint a dark picture of three oligarchs who, the media say, capitalized on Russia s freewheeling post-communism era to engage in financial scandals. Fusion depicted the three as publicity-seeking financial titans who are public figures under U.S. law.Unlike private citizens, public figures face a high bar in libel lawsuits. In this case, the Russian businessmen, if deemed public figures, must prove that Fusion spread the dossier charges with malice   meaning the opposition research firm knew its accusations were untrue or showed reckless disregard for the truth.THREE BILLIONAIRES: Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan are three of the most prominent oligarchs in Russian history,  the Fusion memo states.  With their incredible wealth and political power, each has had a pronounced influence on the economic and political affairs of Russia.   Any search returns an avalanche of articles about their business endeavors, their wealth, their political and economic power, their close relationship with the Kremlin and their misconduct. At issue is Mr. Steele s September 2016 writings devoted to Alfa (which he wrongly spells Alpha), one of 17 memos making up the dossier from June to December 2016.He states that the Alfa Bank paid  illicit cash  directly from Mr. Fridman and Mr. Aven to Mr. Putin via Oleg Govorun, now a senior Kremlin figure,  throughout the 1990s. Mr. Govorun s official resume states that he was an executive for Alfa only from 1997 to 2000.Mr. Steele titled the September memo,  Presidential Election: Kremlin-Alpha Group Co-Operation.

“GUATEMALAN” MAN DIES After Falling Into WASTE GRINDER At Meat Plant…Former Worker Claims They Hire “90% Illegal Aliens”…Including “10-12 Yr Old Kids”,"This story is absolutely horrific, but not surprising. Bleeding heart liberals aren t doing illegal aliens any favors by fighting for them to come here, only to be abused by their employers, who hire them, and then hold their illegal immigration status over their heads when they demand safer working conditions. (See video below)A worker caught in a machine at a meat processing plant has died in Ohio, according to local authorities.Samuel Martinez, 62, was killed by the machine on Saturday afternoon at the Fresh Mark plant in Canton, Ohio.The  Guatemalan national  died at the scene.According to the Stark County Coroner s Office, the man stepped into a chute and was stuck in the waste grinder.In a statement released on Saturday, Fresh Mark said that they would work with local law enforcement to figure out what caused the accident.This afternoon just before 5 pm, we experienced a work-related fatality at our Canton facility, they said. Our primary concern rests with the wellbeing of this employee s family, as well as with the safety and well-being of all our employees in the Canton and other Fresh Mark facilities. We are working with authorities to determine the facts regarding this incident. The incident marks the second of such to happen at the company.In 2011, an employee was electrocuted while trying to plug in a fan as he was standing in water.The company sells pork related meat under the Superior and Sugardale brands.  Daily Mail In 2011, Steve Salvi, the founder of Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC interviewed an Ohio worker that made some startling allegations regarding the alleged hiring of underaged illegal aliens at one of Fresh Mark s Sugardale meatpacking plants in Canton, Ohio. In addition to outing the company for hiring underage illegal alien workers, the former Fresh Mark employee claims a veteran returned from Iraq and applied for a job at the meat processing company. The veteran was allegedly turned down until he could prove that he spoke the Spanish language.In May 2017, the very liberal New Yorker published a story about a 17-year old Guatemalan boy who was too young to work in a factory, and lost his leg due to the unsafe working conditions at neighboring Case Farms in Ohio. The New Yorker says the Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America.Osiel sanitized the liver-giblet chiller, a tublike contraption that cools chicken innards by cycling them through a near-freezing bath, then looked for a ladder, so that he could turn off the water valve above the machine. As usual, he said, there weren t enough ladders to go around, so he did as a supervisor had shown him: he climbed up the machine, onto the edge of the tank, and reached for the valve. His foot slipped; the machine automatically kicked on. Its paddles grabbed his left leg, pulling and twisting until it snapped at the knee and rotating it a hundred and eighty degrees, so that his toes rested on his pelvis. The machine  literally ripped off his left leg,  medical reports said, leaving it hanging by a frayed ligament and a five-inch flap of skin. Osiel was rushed to Mercy Medical Center, where surgeons amputated his lower leg.Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America. In 2015 alone, federal workplace-safety inspectors fined the company nearly two million dollars, and in the past seven years, it has been cited for two hundred and forty violations. That s more than any other company in the poultry industry except Tyson Foods, which has more than thirty times as many employees. David Michaels, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), called Case Farms  an outrageously dangerous place to work.  Four years before 17 year old Guatemalan worker, Osiel L pez P rez lost his leg, Michaels s inspectors had seen Case Farms employees standing on top of machines to sanitize them and warned the company that someone would get hurt. Just a week before Osiel s accident, an inspector noted in a report that Case Farms had repeatedly taken advantage of loopholes in the law and given the agency false information.  The company has a twenty-five-year track record of failing to comply with federal workplace-safety standards,  Michaels said.Case Farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants, who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few Americans would put up with. When these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions, the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers, avoid paying for injuries, and quash dissent. Thirty years ago, Congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for employers who hire unauthorized workers, but trivial penalties and weak enforcement have allowed employers to evade responsibility. Under President Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed not to investigate workers during labor disputes. Advocates worry that President Trump, whose Administration has targeted unauthorized immigrants, will scrap those agreements, emboldening employers to simply call ice anytime workers complain.",politics,"Dec 17, 2017"

BERNIE SANDERS Just Proved His Cluelessness on What Makes Economies Grow [Video],"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said Sunday Democrats would  absolutely  raise the corporate tax rate if they take back control of Congress. If the Democrats take control of the Senate, and you caucus with the Democrats, what s the promise to America about what will be done to reverse the state of affairs that you re so unhappy with?  CBS host John Dickerson asked on  Face The Nation. Sanders jumped into income inequality before changing the subject to child health care and the  Dreamers  before being interrupted by Dickerson to re-ask the original question. If Democrats take control, are corporate taxes going up?  Dickerson asked. I think we re going to take a very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class, and working families, not for the top one percent and large multinational corporations,  Sanders said.Dickerson continued to press Sanders for an answer to Democrats raising corporate tax if they were to take control after the 2018 elections. The Republican tax bill that could pass this week lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent.Sanders is clueless when it comes to business and taxes probably because he has been on the government dole for life. Sanders is in love with Socialism need we say more.",politics,"Dec 17, 2017"
WATCH: Democrat Heads Are Exploding After What Newly Elected Alabama Senator Doug Jones Just Said In Defense Of President Trump and His Supporters," The newly elected US Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) just won the election by a small margin in a state where a Republican hasn t won for 25 years. Jones was pegged as a  liberal  and a  pro-abortion  by his opponents in the highly contentious race against the accused sexual predator, and ultra-conservative candidate, Roy Moore. Jones, however, is no dummy. In a deep-red state who voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2016, Jones knows that he will be a one-term senator unless he gets behind the wildly popular Donald Trump, and based on his first interview with the press, that s exactly what he plans to do.Senator-elect Doug Jones is already breaking with some prominent Democrats by refusing to call for President Trump to step down over ongoing sexual harassment allegations. I don t think that the president ought to resign at this point,  Jones (D-Ala.) told CNN s  State of the Union. In his first round of Sunday show interviews since securing a stunning victory in red state Alabama over accused sexual predator Roy Moore, Jones said he doesn t want to get bogged down in Trump s sexual harassment allegations and would rather work on  real issues. I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues,  Jones added.  Let s get on with the real issues that are facing the people of this country right now. That s at odds with some high-profile Democrats like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) and Cory Booker (NJ) who believe the president should step down because at least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.Unlike other politicians who have stepped down, like Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, Jones said the difference is the voters knew about these allegations and still elected Trump to the highest office. Those allegations were made and he was elected president of the United States,  Jones said.  I think the American people spoke. Jones said he s willing to work with Republicans on passing some of Trump s priorities like infrastructure investment said the sexual harassment allegations are not reason to get on Trump s bad side. We need to move on and try to work with some real issues that are facing the country and not worry about getting at odds with the president any more than we have to,  Jones said.Gillibrand last week said Trump  committed assault  according to the  very credible allegations  and  he should resign. Trump, who has routinely denied any wrongdoing, shot back at the junior senator with what was widely panned as a sexually suggestive tweet Tuesday   the same day Democrats turned out in droves for Jones in Alabama to defeat a Trump-backed candidate.

JUST IN: DISGRACED DEMOCRAT HARRY REID Funneled MASSIVE Taxpayer Funds To Donor For UFO Research Through SECRET Defense Department Program,"The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   FOX News",politics,"Dec 17, 2017"

BIZARRE 2006 FILM Starring Former White House Staffer OMAROSA Surfaces With Crazy Plot Around Stealing Donald Trump’s Hair,"There are conflicting reports about why the outrageous Omarosa Manigault Newman is leaving her undefined job at the White House. It was first reported that she was escorted out of the White House by Secret Service after General Kelly had enough of her nonsense, and fired her. Omarosa appeared on Good Morning America the following day to refute those claims, saying she resigned from her job and was not fired or escorted out of the White House as reported. So who is Omarosa, and why is she such a polarizing figure? Does this 2006 video that just emerged offer any clues?A pop-culture polymath sent Page Six a link to  Soul Sistahs,  an ultra-camp, hyper-kitsch, uber-low-budget 10-minute sci-fi short film.While the plot is virtually incomprehensible, as far as we can tell it focuses on an intergalactic yenta in a housecoat who kidnaps Omarosa in an attempt to steal Donald Trump s hair as part of a difficult-to-understand get-rich-quick scheme.The mini-flick was made back in 2006   two years after Omarosa shot to fame on Trump s NBC show  The Apprentice. In this vaguely  Barbarella -inspired work, the aging villain drugs Omarosa by feeding her spiked cake, whereupon the red PVC-clad former director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison goes off on a motorcycle to steal the future president s hair in a showdown on top of a CGI-created Trump Tower.The film, which has been viewed a mere 6,000 times   as our source put it:  It s a cult classic.

FOX NEWS BOMBSHELL REPORT: Trump Transition Team Lawyer Accuses Robert Mueller Of Improperly Obtaining Documents Related To Russian Probe,"On Friday, Democrats were doing their best to push a rumor that President Trump is about to fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas. According to The Hill   Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that  rumors  on Capitol Hill suggest President Trump could fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas, after Congress leaves Washington for the winter recess. The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make a significant speech at the end of next week. And on Dec. 22, when we are out of D.C., he was going to fire Robert Mueller,  Speier told California s KQED News.The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), also said Friday that he is worried that Republicans leading the committee are seeking to shut down the committee s investigation by the end of the year. Republicans have scheduled no witnesses after next Friday and none in 2017 [sic]. We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on,  he tweeted Friday.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rumors that Trump could fire Mueller have swirled since Mueller s appointment in May.While Democrats are spreading rumors about Mueller s firing, Fox News has dropped another Mueller bombshell.FOX News   A lawyer for the Trump presidential transition team is accusing Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office of inappropriately obtaining transition documents as part of its Russia probe, including confidential attorney-client communications, privileged communications and thousands of emails without their knowledge.In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday, the transition team s attorney alleges  unlawful conduct  by the career staff at the General Services Administration in handing over transition documents to the special counsel s office.The transition legal team argues the GSA  did not own or control the records in question  and the release of documents could be a violation of the 4th Amendment   which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.Kory Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, wrote in Saturday s letter that the GSA handed over  tens of thousands of emails  to Mueller s probe without  any notice  to the transition.The attorney said they discovered the  unauthorized disclosures  by the GSA on December 12th and 13th and raised concerns with the special counsel s office. We understand that the special counsel s office has subsequently made extensive use of the materials it obtained from the GSA, including materials that are susceptible to privilege claims,  Langhofer writes.The transition attorney said the special counsel s office also received laptops, cell phones and at least one iPad from the GSA.Trump for America is the nonprofit organization that facilitated the transition between former President Barack Obama to President Trump.The GSA, an agency of the United States government, provided the transition team with office space and hosted its email servers. We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon,  Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Saturday.The special counsel s office declined to comment Saturday.

Unfortunately for McDowell, his disrespectful interaction with the female law enforcement officer who was attempting to arrest him for disorderly conduct was all caught on camera and shared with TMZ.From Deadspin: The video features a male officer who appears to be tasked with transporting McDowell, but not the one who originally arrested him putting handcuffs on McDowell. At the same time, McDowell is taunting a female cop standing nearby. Are you scared of me?  he asks her repeatedly.  Why is you a cop then? McDowell and the officer go back and forth about why he was arrested for disorderly conduct, and he calls her a bitch multiple times. Bitch, I got money. That s why I can talk shit,  McDowell says, adding that the officers will never make as much money as he s made in the past few months.McDow
